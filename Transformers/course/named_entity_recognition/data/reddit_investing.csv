If I rollover my rollover IRA into my existing 401k before doing BDR, do I have to wait for a minimum duration? For example, if I send my Rollover IRA money to my 401k in April of 2024, then can I do BDR this year without triggering the pro-rata rule? "|1.0|4.0|0.0|4.0

Once the demand for oil and gasoline drops (which is still probably 7–10 years away), what do you think will happen to these stocks (like Shell, Suncor, Exxon, BP, Chevron, and other small midcaps, etc.) 5 years from now?

Is it a good plan to slowly pull out of these stocks? In a year? 3 years? 5 years? 

Oil and gas usage will still be needed for boats, planes, homes, and other commercial applications where EV technology is still multiple decades away. But the loss of the ordinary vehicle or truck market is likely going to have a big negative impact on these companies. 

Can Shell/Exxon, for example, fill in the gap by pivoting towards EV charging pit stops? Can good profits be made as it is expected that an EV charge for 10 to 15 minutes should cost significantly less than equivalent gasoline?

If this is the pivot, what problems could arise? Would it potentialy stress out electrical grids?

The cheapest HDHP insurance premium through my employer comes out to $80 monthly, so $960 annually for insurance premiums. If I did this, I would max out the HSA at $4150 annually or whatever it is.

The alternative is to solely keep contributing to my 401k which I would max out at $23k annually.

(The reason I don't have a HDHP right now is because I actually have chosen not to have insurance at all. I am totally healthy 28 year old and pay out of pocket if I need to see a doctor for something, which in the past has really only been preventative/diagnostic expenses such as lab work and physical exams every 2 years or so. And these expenses are wayyy less than my premiums. Yeah yeah, I know, what if I do develop a health condition or have an accident or emergency.. please spare the argument, I appreciate your concern but that's not what this post is about lol)

Thank you kind redditors!


Edit: Lol everyone commenting on my choice to not have insurance anyways. Okay for the sake of my question, imagine I still have insurance with my parents.

t3_1byzxn5|1712588134.0|investing|Mutual Fund Downside Question|"Hello all,

A friend came to me mentioning something I never heard before and I wanted to get some details to see if this was true. He listened to a finance podcast and it was discussed that, according to him, when someone else sells and asks for the distribution of their mutual funds it will cause some sort of taxable implication for other shareholders because the shares within the fund are now sold and redistributed. Basically saying when someone else sells the same mutual fund you own, you will somehow incur a fee that needs to be covered which makes a mutual fund a disadvantage over an ETF (the episode was about the benefits of ETFs over mutual funds, or something like that).

This makes no sense to me and sounds like he possibly interpreted it wrong. Why would other shareholders pay a tax just because someone else decided to sell? Let me know what you think. Just want to gain some clarity on this.

Thanks

EDIT: Much appreciated for the responses so far. I found some details regarding this after doing more research and, like all have said so far, it is indeed true. Surprised I haven't found these details mentioned as much in different posts when looking at Mutual Funds vs ETFs throughout the years.

I am looking to invest now and into their Index Fund, FXAIX (S&amp;P 500). However, I have a few concerns and questions:
 
1) Is there anything else to add along with FXAIX? Like, is it important to be as diversified in my retirement portfolio? My goal is to keep it simple to focus on capital gains/total returns from one fund. But, if there’s suggestions to make it a 2-fund or 3-fund portfolio, I’ll have a listen to suggestions as well as handle my due diligence.

2) Since Roth IRA is a tax-advantaged account (After-tax dollar grow tax free), are dividend ETF funds something I should consider? Or look into dividends in general if I want to generate cash flow later in my retirement?
 
2) Would lump-sum investing or DCAing investing be ideal? For the sake of example, Iets say I have $20k parked in my Roth IRA right now. Despite the market conditions right now, I’ll invest the whole $20k (lump-sum) into FXAIX sometime this month, and then make the full contribution to my Roth IRA for 2024 ($7k max contribution limit) around the same time next year (April 2025).

Hey everyone,

Just a quick question that I couldn't tackle it for a few days. 

As you know, the only risk that is relevant for purposes of estimating a cost of equity is market or ""risk that cannot be diversified away."" In that sense, a company-specific risk, in my opinion, can easily be diversified away. 

Here's my question: if any risk that can be diversified away should not be considered as an additional risk premium, shouldn't we use a similar cost of capital when valuing Apple and a new-born startup? Because, startup has a company-specific risk like unforeseeable cash flows, but it is something non-systematic and can be diversified away. Right? 

We of course don't use the same cost of capital because the startup is a riskier asset, but what I don't understand here, if we don't consider any additional risk premium for risks that can be diversified away, why don't we use a similar cost of capital for a startup with Apple, Amazon, etc..."|0.25|0.0|0.0|0.0

However I kind of ran to the issue that even when filtering for all of the possible things I can think of (listed below). I still come up with multiple seemingly good options.

I'm struggling to separate them and decide between each other.

Variables I've been filtering for:

* Accumulating distribution
* Domiciled in EU
* Replication of Sampling or Full replication
* Fund size of over 500M

Here are list of some the funds I've looked at:

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I have:

* How important or useful is fund size after certain point? I mean iShares Core MSCIE world has by far the biggest fund of any of them, should I factor this in in some way?
* What justifies some funds having higher TER's? What would be downsides or risks going with something like SPDR MSCI World UCITS ETF that has 0.12 TER?
* How would you view ETF's age? Like is there particular upside or downside to something like Vanguard FTSE all-world UCITS ETF that seems to be less than 5 years old?
* Would you view total holdings as important or is this a case of where 1400+ vs 3000+ companies doesn't really matter as in either case it would be plenty diversified?

Overall I'd just like to hear some views about which things people use to differentiate somewhat similar ETF's and make the decision to which one you buy. One difference I can understand between these examples is the country/sector splits differing slightly, but I'm struggling to understand which of the other factors I asked about above I should consider and how much."|0.63|4.0|0.0|4.0

Treasury ETFs like TBIL pay the current yield of short-term treasuries as a monthly dividend, with the ex-date being the first of the month, and the dividend paid a few days later.

Most brokerage cash accounts are yielding between 2% and 4%, and the interest is calculated based on the average balance.

If one were to hold cash in their portfolio during the whole month and purchase the TBIL ETF the day prior to the ex-date. They would receive the dividend (~5% right now) plus whatever interest they accrued for their brokerage cash, yielding a solid risk-free 7-9% in total.

I hope you reading this are doing well.

I am a mid-career professional, make OK money and save as much as I can. I’ve done so since I started my professional career in my mid-20s. I have a good percentage of my retirement savings in a few mutual funds (Vanguard, Schwab), majority target funds but some just general mutual funds (swppx). I saw a post recently where someone suggested to a poster who had recently come into money to put a chunk into VOO rather than mutual funds because they take fees, are not as strong as just investing in the S&amp;P. I am a believer in the market and want to make my money work for me as much as possible. I’m also not a financial manager but have managed my own finances my whole life.

Should I pull out of my target funds and move to just VOO? Am I getting screwed by mutual funds and not enjoying the market growth I should?

I think there will be a downturn of about 30-50% and maybe more. 

I believe this due to the following:

- High interest rates meaning higher borrowing cost for business. 
- Large companies looking at reducing their workforces.
- High inflation caused by government borrowing and printing more money and running a deficit.
- Confrence board index is signifying a downturn
- Reduced saving and higher credit card balances for the general population.

I'm my mind, it's obvious. Ignore everything else about Trump, just looking at the financials of this company, it's a social media platform that is not growing, and how people are buying on a hope and a prayer. It's a bubble, even the most generous evaluation of the stock says it's overvalued by a lot, the numbers simply do not match reality. And there is even a road map to when it would pop because in less then 6 months Trump can sell his stake.

I'm my mind it's perfect. I mean, the way you lose money on a short is you expect after X time, the stock went up, not down. But in this case, it seems like there is a very obvious time when it's going to crash, if not before. And as for going up???? Only if some massive tomfoolery happens.

My mom looked at me and said ""No, it's a scam, it's a pump and dump, we wouldn't make money."" She also hates the idea of shorting a stock, I think it bit her or her dad (my grandfather) at one point. But it seems like this is the closest thing to a sure bet one can get. 

But then I thought wait, rule number 1 above all in the stock market or any gambling of any kind, ""the only sure thing is that there is never a sure thing.""

So, am I missing something? Should I avoid what looks like a very golden goose because it's all lead?

And, if I did, this would be my first time ever shorting a stock, how would I do it? I have a Fidelity. I have no intention of taking any loans out or anything, just using some cash I have on hand.

For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  
As a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  
Today, here's where I stand:  
\- 61% NVDA  
\- 11% SMTC  
\- 9% MSFT  
\- 6% ORCL  
\- 6% MU  
\- 3% MRVL  
\- 2.5% AMD  
\- 2.5% PLTR  
First off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  
Bottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?"|0.55|1.0|0.0|1.0

Just a thought. There's an approach suggesting that by diversifying sufficiently, we can mitigate our ERP risk. Therefore, there might not be a need to invest solely in, let's say, Türkiye and use its specific ERP, as you could diversify your portfolio and utilize a Global ERP instead.

However, why can't this approach be applied to beta? For instance, the beta for renewable energy is 0.6, automotive is 0.9, and another risky industry is 1.3, and so forth. You can also influence beta by diversifying it. Isn't the cost of capital essentially an opportunity cost? Following the same reasoning as with ERP, shouldn't beta theoretically be equal to 1, considering the potential for diversification?

My dad set it up just before I started my job and I wasn't really interested at that point. It has been putting in £100 a month (direct debit, regular investment) for a majority of this time, however just before the new tax year I started putting in £300 a month. Note, this is for a LISA.

I've started to take a greater interest in my investments and one thing that really confuses me are the HL fees. All my HL investments are in Indexes (i.e. S&amp;P 500, Legal &amp; General Global Tech, FTSE 100 etc.). I see this crazy fees of £11.95 per order but then also just £3.75 per month.

The portfolio consisted of two funds SOPAX and SBLGX, both of which had \~5% front load and 1.03% expense ratio. Apparently, Primerica also had a bunch of fees on top of that. When the funds were moved over, I liquidated them and moved them into low cost ETFs.

I'm now reading a report made available to me about the observations of that liquidation event.

SBLGX (held since 2017)

* Quantity: 798.512
* Cost basis: $38,295.37
* Proceeds: $42,951.96
* Short-Term gain/loss: +$524.17
* Long-Term gain/loss: +$4,132.42

SOPAX (held since 2016)

* Quantity: 350.725
* Cost basis: $9,156.93
* Proceeds $9,897,46
* Short-Term gain/loss: +$128.54
* Long-Term gain/loss: +$611.99

&amp;#x200B;

Someone please correct me if I'm reading this wrong, but in both of these funds combined, Primerica and these Clearbridge funds took $38,295.37 + $9,156.93 = $47,452.30 over the last 7 years? The proceeds are the ""revenue"" more or less?

I spent nearly 50% of the entire net worth of the portfolio on fees? Adjusted for inflation over 7 years, I probably made little to no gains relatively speaking? Someone knock some sense into me and tell me I'm just analyzing this all wrong.

Merrill offers MMFs through three different brokers, BlackRock, Federated Hermes (never heard of these guys before) and Fidelity. Each broker has multiple funds broken down by different class types - Institutional, Cash Reserve, Premier, Advisor, Class I, etc.  As all of them essentially have the same 7-day yield, (5.15%-5.30%) not really sure if there's a functional difference between any of them as far as I'm concerned?

I understand compound *interest*, but investing in the S&amp;P500 doesn't yield any interest? It does pay dividends, but that is \~1.5%, which obviously doesn't account for the annual average of \~7% return.  
So where does the compounding come from - growth in share price, only?  
If it is growth, and that growth is eventually exponential, then doesn't that mean that the average company in the S&amp;P is also experiencing exponential growth? and is obviously unsustainable.   
Any gains are only realised when sold, and THEN potentially reinvested.  
So where does the compounding happen? What returns are being reinvested to give the compounding?  
Do all flavour S&amp;P500 ETF's operate this compounding the same way (assuming you manually reinvest returns from DIST funds, ACC takes care of itself).

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.  
  
YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).  
However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):  
\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).  
  
***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***  
  
A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

  
**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**  
  
I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE—an affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.  
  
It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.  
  
Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies – an incredible accomplishment!  
  
With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**  
  
\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.  
  
**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know**  
  
\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).  
  
**Battery Swapping Network**  
  
\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.  
  
**Share Price**  
  
\- Listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

Now if on Wednesday of that same week it went up 10% and is trending this way to market close and you lock it in before. You would sell it for this price?

With how fluctuating some stocks are, what are the obvious and glaring cons to just continuing to repeat this approach. 

If say you bought the stock at an even $100 and it trended up to $200 after a few months, and then it started a week long gradual spiral and is at $180 and you decide to sell it then. Wouldn’t you just profit the $80.

I was hoping I can get some advice about things I might not be thinking about when it comes to evaluating such a small company in this sector.  Here's some facts about this company.

Their primary location is in Oklahoma, in Caney shale fields surrounded by big players like Exxon.  These fields produce about 75/25 ratio of oil to gas. They have a couple partnerships with Exxon and have also sold some Woodford drilling rights to them in the past.  Now the company operates exclusively in the Caney region.

Total proved reserves (about 25,000 MBOE, net) are recently valued at $480 million (10% discount). When you account for tax liability on some of the reserves, it's about $400 million  (based on $76 2024 WTI oil price).  The auditor is Netherland Sewell. I get the sense that management feels Netherland Sewell is overly conservative.  It's probably reasonable to consider some of the additional ""probable"" reserves totaling 17,000 MBOE, net.  Proved + Probable is 42,000 MBOE, net.

They have recently expanded their drilling operation in the last two years.  This has increased their output to about 2700-3000 BOEPD from 1700 BOEPD last year. By the end of 2024, they will likely be pumping 3500-4000 BOEPD.

This expansion has disrupted their cashflow.  They have borrowed about $25 million of a $40 million credit line (which is interest only, SOFR + 4%, until 2026).  Their last quarter's end cash position was $500K.  

The lender also requires them to hedge some of their output, which has hurt their profits last quarter.  This part get's difficult to summarize, but they have costless collars into 2025 on 270 MBOE with an average upside cap of $83 per BOE and a downside cap of $62. 

I'm still waiting on their Q4 numbers, but their est. revenue (based on $71 WTI), is about $51-53 Million for 2023, and I think the 2023 earnings will come in around $17-18 million.  For 2024, assuming $70 WTI and successful drilling operations on a few new wells, I estimate their net earnings will be about $20-25 million on about $60-65 million in revenue.  They currently do not do buybacks or pay a dividend.  Their current netback per BOE (accounting for hedging) is about $42-48.  

Considering their proved reserves minus their debt and tax liability, I figure the company is worth easily $250 million as a fire-sale buyout price.   I noticed that many of these micro E&amp;P companies trade under their book value, but this one seems particularly cheap.  

In addition to the poor cash flow and unfortunate hedging positions, they also have a low insider ownership of 1%.  Considering those negatives, I still think this is looking like a net positive story.   What else am I missing?"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0
t3_1bw0pzw|1712268909.0|investing|Dividend vs Growth stocks|"I think this topic might have been discussed extensively. But I have not found a strong argument to invest in high dividend stocks, compared to growth stocks.

Dividend stocks have two things going for it: (i) regular generation of cash, (ii) lower than capital gain tax advantage.

Despite this advantage, what I don't feel good is that high dividend stocks seems like a bait to invest into failing businesses. Many of them have lost in values for years. So, you gain regular cash incomes, but you lose values in your investment.

Worse, I don't have strong data to back this up, but it seems like when these companies are doing better, they cut down their dividend yields.  

Now, I feel much more comfortable investing in growth stocks.  It feels like you bet on success.  Now, to generate incomes, you liquidate some of it.  Sure you pay higher tax, but overall it seems like you get a better deal of investing in a growth stock that increases in 20% in value in the past 5 years, than investing in a stock with 5% dividend yield that loses 20% in value in the past 5 years.

Am I missing anything?

Lets say you have 10k in a high yield savings account (Citi/Marcus/Amex) and the interest rate is 5%.

Per annual year, you're expected to get $500 back + the compound interest earned on a monthly basis.

Everyday your expected value is $500/365 days...

Interest is paid out on the last day of each month, what happens if I take $$ 1 day before the last day, or even on the last day.

Is the daily interest accrued based on the daily ending balance? Is that the standard practice?

My rental income is paid on the 1st, and the mortgage is drawn on the 5th, will I get paid the daily interest for the 4th on the 10k if I move it from savings to checking on the 4th at 11:00 PM? 

Will I get interest for the 10k on both the 4th and the 5th if I move it at 1:00 AM on the 5th? What if there's malpractice from these banks/HYSA, can we class action sue and get paid millions?

t3_1bvy4pq|1712263056.0|investing|How does Wash Sale rule apply in this example?|"Let’s say I have 2,000 shares of stock ABC.

I bought 1,800 shares over three years ago (well before the “30 days before” wash sale rule).

My original 1,800 shares could have been sold and the losses used to deduct from my gains this year. 

Here’s where things change, and I’m unsure how the wash sale rules apply:
1. I sold some covered calls on the 1,800 shares within the past 30 days for about $5k in premium.
2. I bought the call options back to reclaim my 1,800 shares collateral, also within the past 30 days.
3. I bought another 200 shares, bringing my total to 2,000 shares, also within the past 30 days.

If I were to sell all 2,000 shares now, does the “30 days before/after” wash sale rule only apply to the 200 shares I recently bought, it does it apply to all 2,000 shares even though only the recent purchase of 200 shares violated the rule?

Also, do the coveted calls I sold/bought back affect anything here as well?

I’m considering just waiting a month before selling to clear the wash sale rules, unless the original 1,800 shares are clear to sell at a loss and still deduct the losses against profits this year. "|0.56|2.0|0.0|2.0

I am 32 and finally setting myself up for my future. Here is my current setup. I own a chocolate company and have a business partner 50/50 split and we have two employees we hired this last year (part time and will likely fizzle out during summer as it's a fairly seasonal company)

I am reading a ton about all of the IRAs possible as I really want to make sure I am investing for my future.

From what I am reading I could either open a SEP-IRA but that would be 25% of my W-2 from the S-Corp (which is at $26,900 to mitigate taxes (total business profit last year was $122k)) so it seems like my SEP contribution would only max out at $6,700 ish

Someone recently told me that I could do a 401k and that would be more lucrative can anyone explain why or what they would do in this setup / situation? I maxed out my ROTH for 2023 already! So I am moving in some direction, but I am rather new to all of this!

Bonus Question: I have around $300k liquid right now and no debt I am thinking about dumping all of it outside of my emergency fund into VOO / VXUS 80/20 split and letting it sit. I am thinking I am in the window to look at purchasing my first home finally.

So questions are:

1. Would I just leave out like $100k for a down payment and see about getting a house first?

2. Are those good ETFs to put my money in for the long term or what would you recommend I do to allocate that?

3. Do I need a financial advisor / is it worth it to pay them 1% or can I just pretty much dump all of this money in there and get about the same results?

4. Do I just dump it all in if it's just sitting in my bank account right now? Just all of it? Or do I do it slowly? Whats the general theory on that.

Sorry for all of the questions. but I REALLY appreciate any help / insight you may be able to provide here :) I am super excited about setting up my future!!"|0.63|4.0|0.0|4.0

t3_1bvru62|1712248664.0|investing|PSA for those 'investing' in UNG or BOIL|"It made me sick to my stomach that I had to give my dad 'the talk' for the second time about 'investing' in UNG and BOIL. He's retired on social security, and keeps dabbling in UNG/BOIL to express his views on natural gas. And regardless of how wrong he's been on the direction of nat gas, he has had trouble understanding how the structure of these ETFs has been even more destructive to his portfolio than his views on natural gas.

UNG owns the front month contract, and periodically rolls that position into the following month contract. Based on the shape of the futures curve ([https://oilprice.com/futures/natural-gas/](https://oilprice.com/futures/natural-gas/)), the June contract costs 2.015 and the May contract costs 1.794. If you were to roll the May futures into June futures today, you'd lose around 11%. If you rolled every month for a year and lost 11% each time, you'd lose around 75% over the course of a year, assuming the price of nat gas and the shape of the curve are stable for the whole year. Even if NG has a bullish move, that roll cost drag creates a massive bogie to overcome. This vehicle is not appropriate for expressing any view on NG prices beyond a VERY short period (days/weeks).

As if that weren't bad enough, BOIL does the same thing - but with 2x leverage! Assuming it now costs you 22% each month to roll to the next month, over the course of a year, you lose 95% just on roll costs. Even if NG is discovered to be a magic elixir that, when ingested, cures all illness including old age...and the entire global population switches from drinking water to drinking LNG; even in that farcical scenario, you'd probably still lose money on BOIL over the course of a year.

If you have a bullish view on NG and absolutely have to express it, please consider UNL instead. It's run by the same sponsor as UNG, but instead of only owning the front month contract, it owns each of the next 12 months' contracts at equal weights, and only rolls one month at a time, or 1/12 of the portfolio each month. That dramatically lessens the pain of the roll cost when the futures curve is upward-sloping (as it often is). Just be careful and consider using limit orders since UNL is a much smaller fund than UNG or BOIL, and accordingly has wider bid/ask spreads.

To hammer home this message, over the past 5 years, UNL has lost 25%, UNG has lost 83.5%, and BOIL has lost 99.65%. In order to get back to even in each one: UNL would have to gain 33%, UNG would have to gain 506%, and BOIL would have to gain **28,471%!!!** All while still eroding from their respective roll costs.

**TLDR:** Please understand what your ETFs own and what they're designed to do. If they own futures, know which ones they own, how often they roll, and keep an eye on the futures curve so you know how much the roll cost is eating into your capital on a regular basis. And for the love of God, don't buy a leveraged ETF that owns futures with an upward-sloping futures curve unless you know exactly what you're buying, and for how long (minutes/days at most).

And if this was all greek to you: just avoid buying commodities ETFs or ETNs, and instead stick to equity and bond funds.

PRO TIP: Google ""\[symbol\] fact sheet"" and look at recent fund holdings to see what your ETF actually owns."|0.53|1.0|0.0|1.0

My question is what happens if I don’t expect to meet those income tiers and due to a raise or change in career actually fall within those tiers after having already maxed out my Roth IRA for the year.

I make about $145/yr, but roughly $30k of that comes from an annual bonus, so my monthly income isn’t just the total divided by 12 as you’d expect. 

I bring home about $6300/mo. I have $7k in a savings account and save $600/mo, $2k in credit card debt, and just shy of $40k in my 401k which I contribute 5% to. My monthly expenses are about $2000/mo. 

I would like to start investing, but I also would like to build up more savings so I have enough for an emergency fund AND large expenses like home improvements, and expensive hobbies guess I’m wondering…

 - Is my savings account enough for an emergency fund?

- Would I be better off continuing to save in a typical savings account instead of starting to invest now if there’s a strong possibility that in the next 1-3 years I’d be withdrawing from my investment accounts to cover large planned expenses?

- Should paying down that credit card debt be priority number one right now?

- What stocks/index funds would be good if I want low/medium risk in case I’m not sitting on the investments for 5+ years?

- Would I be better off increasing my 401k contributions or starting to invest otherwise? (My employer makes an annual contribution regardless of my personal contribution, so match isn’t a factor)

- Are there any higher yield savings accounts out there that would sort of split the difference between a standard account and an investment account without requiring a large initial deposit/minimum balance?

My MIL invested $50,000 in a company called QT Ultrasound LLC in 2019. She died shortly afterward, and my wife inherited those shares. The tax documents we received for 2019 were a K-1 from QT Ultrasound, which listed my wife as a “Partner” and her “member’s share” therein was listed as .0169.  
  
Over the past few years we have done nothing with this, and have received nothing from QT Ultrasound. Sometimes they didn’t even bother to send a K-1 and it was always a pain in the butt getting any sort of information from them. We knew it was illiquid, and so we figured we’d just wait and see what happened. Out of sight, out of mind.  
  
A few weeks ago we received a flurry of emails from QT, and a big announcement that they were finally taking the company public through a SPAC. This finally happened, and now the company is publicly traded under the designation QTI.  
  
We were informed that our investment would be converted into common stock, and that the number of shares would be 1,700. I was rather surprised to see, however, that the value of these shares was $1.35 on March 5, 2024 (the first day of trading). Now, as the stock has gone down even further, our holdings are now worth about $1,500. A far cry from $50,000…  
  
Now, I know that investing is a risk, yada yada yada… But can somebody explain this to me like I am five: how and why did an investment in an LLC that seemed to become more and more successful during the five years since our MIL first invested lose almost all its value when the company went public?

To be clear, I am not seeking advice about what to do! I just want to better understand what happened, or might have happened.  
  
Any insights, informed guesses, etc. will be most welcome.

We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&amp;P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&amp;P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&amp;P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?  

Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&amp;P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.  "|0.26|0.0|0.0|0.0

If you’re trying to accumulate and invest $1+ mil in either your retirement or taxable brokerage account, chances are it’ll take you a long time to reach your “Living off Dividends” dream by generating $30k, $40k, or $50k+ in annual dividends. I think that’s a pipe dream for the average person and that they’ll see their dreams come true when they’re already in their death beds.
 
So, what if we approached this concept in a more practical manner? What if one would like to generate between just $5k-$10k in annual dividends? I believe it’s attainable – pending the individual’s circumstances and how consistent and committed they are to reach that goal. And I think $5k - $10k a year would cover most essential necessities in life.
 
Please let me know if that’s feasible for the average person. Thank you!

***EDIT***: I guess I should have been clear from the beginning. I don’t think chasing after the dividend for a large “payout” is ideal, but should be part of smaller allocation of your overall portfolio. So, yes, to live solely on $5k-$10k just to cover essential necessities is illogical and asinine from a long-term investing perspective."|0.72|233.0|0.0|233.0

Hello all,
I'm asking for financial advice on behalf of my mother. When her husband passed away over 5 years ago she received a windfall from his pension paying out 3 years of his salary, this is in the form of a Contributory IRA. she was advised to invest into municipal bonds ""because those don't pay taxes"". She has it mostly invested into VNYTX (New York State muni bonds) and a smaller chunk in VTEB, which pay a dividend so she has had both on DRIP. She has another Roth IRA with a much smaller amount invested in a CD, and another contributory IRA with an even smaller amount invested in VTI and VXUS. 

Is there are sense for her to have tax exempt bonds in an IRA? Because it's not a Roth, I think she would have had to pay capital gains once she started to sell (or withdraw?), but she invested this around mid-2019 when bonds were much higher and has since suffered significant losses. 

Would it be a large tax event for her to sell especially the NY muni bond portion, and use it to repurchase more VTEB? Does she even need to stick with muni bonds in a traditional IRA, or would it make more sense to go with BND? She is very risk averse and of retirement age (67, but still working because she likes to)  
so convincing her to buy equity ETFs is not an option. Would she benefit from selling and taking a ~50,000 capital loss to have for the next 16 years to offset any future capital gains? 
Sorry if my questions are elementary, I'm very young so the extent of my investing knowledge is how to buy, I'm too far from retirement to have learned how to sell.

Forgive me if this was covered in the past, but since 2016 my employer offered a Simple IRA plan. My employer explained it was tax deferred and they match up to 3%. I’ve always added the man of 3% for a total of 6%.

Well I’m trying to understand all things regarding this account and how I can optimize it better. I’m afraid I’ve missed out on how well I could.

Firstly, it’s through Capital Group: American Funds. Upon logging in, it says CB&amp;T CUST SIMPLE IRA. The funds are: AMERICAN FUNDS TARGET DATE 2050 - C (369). 

Since 7/5/16, I’ve added $26,844. There’s a total of $37,603 after.

Since I know basically nothing here, here are my questions. 

How do I find out if this is setup pre tax or post tax? My employer keeps saying post tax and “Roth Ira” but a simple Ira can’t be a Roth right?  I understand the contributions heavily change as well depending on how it’s setup. Online when I login, it doesn’t tell me what it is. Perhaps I need to call them and ask?


Are C funds good? Since that is all I’m offered? I’ve heard C funds are ok but can be expensive and may be lining the financial advisors pocket more than mine? I have other options to invest, but all are C funds. 

If this retirement account is good, what should I do to be more aggressive and maximize my retirement from 37 here on out? Like investment strategy, and what other retirement accounts can I have with it?

If this retirement account sucks, what options do I have to move these funds into something better and how does that work with my employer match. 

Honestly, I want to manage and invest as intelligently/agressively as I can for retirement and I’m upset I haven’t looked into it before now.

But if I don't exercise them soon, I will lose them completely. I was in a similar situation years ago and I let the options go, and then a year later, instead of going public, they were bought by a competitor, and so I lost out on a fair amount of money by not exercising any options.

So this time around, I came across vested.co , which claims to pre-IPO shares and only takes a cut on profit. Sounds a little too good to be true to me, and especially since the only matches on reddit for this company are from Indian investing subreddits.

To note 
I was just promoted this year 
I was already a HCE the last 2 years and only did 11% of my pay for 401k because it said that’s all I could do.  Company matched up to 5%


I have the opportunity to enroll in SSRP.
There is a line that says “contribute more than the RSIP (401k I assume?) will allow because my RSIP CONTRIBUTIONS are now limited by the earlier of:
1) The highly compensated employee (HCE) RSIP plan limit of $12,000 and the 11% max deferral percentage 
2) irs limit of $345000
Receive the full company matching contribution in the event your RSIP deferrals are stopped before the end of the 2024 calendar year. 


So is this saying basically I can still do the 11% but now I can do even more and the company will match that 5% on top of the 11% I am doing?

Does this mean I can only do 12,000 in my 401k since each of the last years I did 11% and it was no issue.

Thank you.

**The long version (posted this in** r/Bogleheads **this weekend but it didn't get much attention--bad idea to post during Easter--so reposting here and hoping for a little more traction):**

My wife and I are in our early 40s. We both have decent jobs with steady income and are maxing out our employer sponsored plans. We are maxing out our ROTHs. We have more than a full year of emergency cash set aside and and we have no remaining mortgage on our house or other debts. We also have a 2 year old and we just started a 529 plan for her that will be sizeable when/if she's ready to attend college. She is and will remain an only child. So I think we're on track for retirement in 20 years or so and she will have a nice chuck for college if she wants to go. With our jobs and all the contributions listed above, we still have excess cash coming in that we just don't spend and it is starting to accumulate. So we thought why not take some (not all) of the excess and regularly invest it through a traditional taxable brokerage, let it grow without withdrawals, and then let our daughter inherit the stepped up basis of that account when we pass away (in addition to whatever else she inherits). The plan is that we do this for our remaining working years and hopefully continue it in our retirement years if financial circumstances allow.  It is with Fidelity FWIW and in case anyone recommends a custodial account instead, we looked into it and decided against it for a variety of reasons that I won't go into detail about here.

If we're holding this taxable account in our names and making regular contributions for decades but not planning/hoping to withdraw any money, we obviously want to avoid as much tax as possible on dividends and gains over the years. We've done some research on this situation and understand that ETFs are generally preferred over mutual funds in a taxable account because they pay less capital gains. So we are leaning toward ETFs. Then the question becomes which ETF(s)? Conventional wisdom suggests a mix of US and international stocks plus bonds. VT seems like a one-and-done option for US + International. Other ideas? Also, does it still make sense to buy bonds for an account like this since we're not trying to preserve value/gains for retirement. Don't bond funds pay higher dividends which again we want to avoid? Obviously we're leaning away from bonds but we could be convinced otherwise if there is a compelling reason to hold them. Thank you!"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

I don't know the EXACT date I'll return, so it could be 2 years, could be 2.5, could be 3. But it's very unlikely it will be less than two years away.

My research shows two good options: parking the money in VMFXX's, which has a 7-day yield is 5.28% and an expense ratio of 0.11%. However, I'm also a member of Navy Federal, and for more than $100k, they will let me open a 12-month certificate at 5.10%.

I'm no expert, but my understanding is that VMFXX's yield is variable and could go down, subject to market interest rates -- however, it's rather liquid in that I could transfer the cash back at any time. Inversely, the certificate I described is less-liquid, and considering no expense fees, is extremely close in return -- and it's guaranteed at that rate for 12 months.

I'm currently inclined to put it in the certificate and reevaluate on a rolling 12-month basis.

However, towards the end of Chapter 8, the authors briefly discuss the option to implement the Lifecycle Investing strategy via buying ETFs on margin instead of LEAPS. They don’t really come to a conclusion though about why they still prefer LEAPS; in fact, they seem to be praising the idea of buying on margin (within reason of course). 

Doing some quick math, it seems like buying on margin is a *much* cheaper implantation of their strategy compared to buying LEAPS, even in this period of much higher interest rates compared to when they wrote the book. Let’s look at some numbers. SPY is at $522 right now, for reference. 

Option 1: $100k in SPY, plus another $100k in SPY on margin at Interactive Brokers. 
An interest rate of 6.83% compounded daily is an annual cost of $7067.95. 
I itemize deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, so I get 22% of that back, leaving me with $5513.00 in margin fees. 
But I also get 1.22% dividend yield on 200k of investment, or $2440. 15% of that I lose to capital gains tax, leaving me with $2074.
That leaves me with a total cost to borrow of $3439, or 3.44% annually. 

Option 2: ~$200k in SPY LEAPS. I can’t buy fractional options, so let’s say it’s 4 of the Jan 2026 $260 call, which is trading for around $280 at the moment. That‘s a $20 premium, which is $8000 cost to borrow over 21 months, or $4571.43 annualized. I’ve effectively gotten a $104,800 loan with these LEAPS (($522-$260)x400), so that’s a total cost to borrow of 4.36%. Nearly a whole point higher than just buying on margin. 

I know I’m hand waiving over a few details, but I don’t think it changes the conclusion that buying on margin comes out cheaper, even today. I’m confused how this wasn’t true back when the boom was written as well. Am I missing something?"|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0

What is causing the unexpected increased demand? Multiple scholarly articles have shown covid can greatly increase the risk of new onset dementia.  A systemic review in The Lancet shows a 60% increased risk of dementia at 6 months for the covid group.  And it showed a 1700% increased risk for elderly survivors of severe covid.  The National Institute of Health found rapid progression of dementia in patients with pre-existing dementia:

""But covid has been around since 2020.  Wouldn't we have seen increased demand for nursing homes and elderly care in the first years of the pandemic?""

First, there were a lot of deaths in the elderly in 2020-22.  This would have reduced demand for nursing homes, concealing the effect of increasing dementia rates.  Also, there's a lag of months to years between the time of dementia onset to admission to nursing homes.  It takes time for family and health professionals to recognize the changes and for the patient to be moved/admitted.  And third, the effect of multiple infections is cumulative.  Partial immunity may lessen the severity and prevent most deaths. But some effect on brain occurs.  

The neurological effect on the elderly is going to increase demand for nursing homes and elderly care for years to come.

If anyone can help me figure out this math so I can make a decision to maximize wealth long-term, I would really really appreciate it because I'm definitely feeling lost. Here are my stats:

**Salary:** $205,000

**Loans:** I have three student loans: (1) $20,500 at 4.3%, (2) $20,500 at 5.28%, and (3) $20,500 at 6.54%. So far, I only have one month of interest accumulated, and I do have the option to pay off each debt separately (so I can pay off the 6.54% loan first if I want to). 

**Investing:** I currently have an investment account with Vanguard that is returning about 12.8%

**Retirement:** I have a 401K with Charles Schwab that my new employer opened for me; so far, it's set at the default of 5% contribution, but I can max it to 10%.

**Savings:** I have about $22k in savings that I can use flexibly to pay off the student loans or use a different way.

**Other Expenses:** low

**Questions:** What would you all do? Should I make minimum payments on the student loans and instead contribute to my 401k or Investment account? Should I use the $22k I have saved to pay off the loan that's at 6.54%?

t3_1bsdxxt|1711901201.0|investing|Robinhood for long term investors|"So I started with Vanguard and have been using them for 6 years. I'm a long term investor in Vanguard ETFs and index funds. I currently have about $250K split between a Roth IRA, IRA, and brokerage account. I plan to keep growing past $1M with this strategy.  

The current RH incentives have me looking at switching like so many others. I have about $100K in IRAs so that's a free $3K just for switching. Possibly more as it looks like they may be matching other deposits pretty soon. On top of this the ongoing incentives with RH gold should net me at least $250/yr.

I'm extremely happy with Vanguard and curious as to what I'd be losing by switching.

The Vanguard UI/reporting is perfect in my opinion. It very clearly shows investing performance. It shows total deposits, historical gains as a percentage/$ value on a per account basis with various time range options including a custom range option. Buying funds/ETFs is extremely simple as well. It's very much suited to my style of investing. Also I think Vanguard will still be around 30 years from now so I'll still have all that reporting from all the years of investing. This is valuable to me as someone that has goals and likes to track their investments.

My concerns with RH is that it seems to be more suited to short term investing and stock picking. I signed up for an account and the dashboard page is promoting individual stocks and cryptos. I see historical reporting for up to 1Y and ALL, but don't see a custom time range option. I can't access the 'Retirement' tab yet so I'm wondering how the reporting is for those accounts, and if I'll be able to have both an IRA and Roth IRA there.

So what I'm wondering is, has anyone in my type of position switched to RH and how has it gone?

Also, has anyone been with Robinhood for a long time and how is the reporting?

I would like to hear any opinions about RH for long term investors."|0.62|20.0|0.0|20.0

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!"|0.57|4.0|0.0|4.0

t3_1brkf9i|1711812319.0|investing|I 24m am THOROUGHLY CONVINCED that renting and investing in stocks is better than owning a home most of the time.|"I've made this post several times in several forums and for the most part, everyone on reddit and in real life tell me that owning a home is better than renting and I just don't get it.

  
After witnessing my parents AND grandparents continuously complain about home ownership, I am truly, thoroughly convinced that I would be better off renting than owning throughout this lifetime.  
This is why:

  
(for context, we live in a 5000 sq ft home in illinois) (also, I do not own the home, I live with my parents)

&amp;#x200B;

1. My mom recently was complaining about the gas bill. It was $400 alone for gas last month.
2. Property tax alone is over 13k per year.

&amp;#x200B;

About $1500 per month on property tax and gas only..... Isn't there the actual mortgage to pay too? And electricity? and im sure there is insurance along with other expenses that I don't know about.

  
**With what my mom pays in property tax and gas ALONE, you can use that money to completely rent out a nice place AND not have any headache about maintenance.**

  
**That one single reason alone is already proof enough for me to rent instead of own.**

  
So what reason is there to own a home?? you get equity? What good is that if $1500/mo is going to leave your pocket anyway REGARDLESS if the home is completely paid off or not?? Even if the house is completely paid off, $1500/mo is still going towards property tax and gas alone??

  
**You might as well pay 1500/mo in rent AND INVEST THE DIFFERENCE IN SP500 RIGHT??**

  
You can argue that the home value goes up over time, but does it go up faster than the sp500 over many decades??

  
You can argue that rent per month goes up, but does it go up faster than the sp500 over many decades?

  
My parents also complain about clogged toilets, sump pump this, leaky roof that. All this maintenance that YOU have to take care of.

  
My grandparents have their own house in california and their bathroom is being remodeled or whatever and they said it's 10k. 10k for just a bathroom remodel?? Add 2k to that and you have enough to rent 1000/mo for 1 year  


  
TL;DR: Why own the house when the property tax and gas only is already 1500/mo, when you can just rent a nice place for 1500/mo and invest the difference into the sp500?? 1500/mo on property tax and gas only. Doesn't include mortgage, electricity, insurance, and whatever else homeowners have to pay.

Worried About Investing in a Frothy Market? Try Dollar-Cost Averaging.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-investing-dollar-cost-averaging-60497c1b?st=zbetiv1v8hcpnfn

&gt; b uying low and selling high is the investing ideal, but it’s impossible to do all the time, even for Wall Street professionals. Instead, financial advisors tend to recommend dollar-cost averaging, and they say it can especially make sense in a frothy market like the current one where nothing is cheap.

&gt; Markets tend to go up roughly three out of every four years, which means investing a lump sum at the beginning of the year will pay off more time than not. There are two problems, says Rachel Elson, a financial advisor at Perigon Wealth Management in San Francisco, who tends to work with younger clients. The first is that we never know what the markets will do in any particular year. The second is that people tend to have an emotional attachment to money, and seeing a new investment evaporate in a market rout is painful.

&gt; Dollar-cost averaging takes fear out of the equation. If you contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement account like a 401(k), chances are you are already dollar-cost averaging, since you are investing money at a steady cadence with each paycheck. But you can also use the strategy in your individual retirement accounts or taxable brokerage accounts via automatic transfers or setting a recurring calendar reminder.

&gt; While dollar-cost averaging is the go-to strategy for many investors during all market cycles, advisors say dolling out your investment over time makes the most sense when prices are high. You are smoothing out your returns, taking advantage of any more upswing to come, but also not risking a massive drop after you have invested a lump sum.

&gt; When investors read headlines about the stock market hitting record highs, as they have in recent weeks, they can get analysis paralysis, says Marianela Collado, a financial advisor with Tobias Financial Advisors who recommends dollar-cost averaging to many of her clients and uses the strategy herself. As a result, investors may want to wait out high prices and volatility. But “you’re really not going to find the perfect time to invest,” Collado says. “Dollar-cost averaging allows you to tune out all the noise and just be disciplined and focused.”

&gt; Researchers at Vanguard calculated the wealth of a $100,000 initial investment using historical stock and bond performances and found that after a year, lump-sum investing tends to outperform dollar-cost averaging. But the researchers also admitted that for some risk-averse investors, dollar-cost averaging may be the better approach “because it reduces the risk of drawdown or even abandoning their investment plan altogether because they fear large losses.”

&gt; with dollar-cost averaging, you can increase returns during tough market conditions. Researchers at Raymond James took a look at 40 years of the S&amp;P 500’s performance and found that investors who put a lump sum in the market during a market peak saw an average annualized 10-year return of 8.3%, while those who began investing at a peak but used the dollar-cost averaging method over seven months enjoyed an average annualized 10-year return of 10.4%.

&gt; If you have put in place a strict dollar-cost averaging plan, you are bound to miss out on what could be huge returns from investing a lump sum during a market bottom. But, especially for investors with less experience who are hoping to buy in amid current high prices, dollar-cost averaging is likely to give you peace of mind, confidence to keep investing in the future and strong results over the long term

The last two real world, examples and research I found to be pretty interesting. Especially in market conditions like we have now.

1. portfolio A with 100% shares 
2. portfolio B with 100% bonds  


For both portfolio A and portfolio B,  only limited details are given as follows:

1. the start year of investment (end of the year): 2008
2. the latest year of investment : 2021
3. the initial capital for investment: 2 million
4. additional capital invested in the portfolio (yearly at the end of the year): 100K

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking to benchmark annual interest rate for portfolio A with the S&amp;P500 close price obtained from Yahoo Finance with the following formula:

  
Annual interest rate = \[(close price in 2021/ close price in 2008)\*\*(1/ (2021-2008)) \] -1 = r

Future value = 2mil\*(1+ r)\*\*(2021-2008) + 100K((1+r)\*\*n -1)/r)  


For portfolio B, I am thinking to benchmark the annual interest rate with Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index or Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index but I could not seem to find them on Yahoo Finance. Any suggestion to obtain historical data for these 2 indices? If the close price of the initial year and latest year of investment are given for the Bond index, how do I compute the annual interest rate and future value?

To address another big point, she bought the home before we were married. It's in her name, and ultimately she gets to decide what is done with the proceeds.

When does it make sense to scale back retirement savings in favor of non-retirement savings?

I am 37 years old with around $1.2 million in retirement (401k + HSA + Roth IRA + wife’s trad and Roth IRAs) and a little over $500k non retirement savings.

With my employer match included, we currently save around $82,000 a year. About $62,000 of that is retirement savings (max 401k contribution $23,000 plus $24,000 employer match plus max $7,000 Roth IRA contribution plus max HSA contribution of $8,300), and only $20,000 non-retirement savings (give or take).

At the rate we’re going, it’s looking like it’s reasonable to expect to get to $20 million in retirement accounts by 65, just using 9% return assumption. Non-retirement savings using the same assumption gets me to maybe $2,800,000 at that same point and that’s assuming we don’t use those funds for non-retirement type stuff.

I enjoy saving on tax dollars as much as the next guy, but the balance seems off and will diverge more and more. It seems like it would be prudent to provide more non-retirement flexibility, but I have a hard time “stepping backwards” with retirement savings."|0.73|42.0|0.0|42.0

While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI.

So I have just started a small loan book, the plan is to have each loan average approx 20% and I’ve found somewhere that provides a somewhat steady stream to do this. Each loan can range from 20-200 USD/EUR/GBP. I hope to get the loan book to approx. 8000 EUR. To do this I plan on issuing approx 400 EUR of new loans each month (monthly contribution) and then all the previous months combined initial and interest . I will then liquidate and build a dividend portfolio.

I was thinking something to start maybe KO or O. It has a relatively stable price and with an 8000 initial each dividend payout would allow for 1 additional share. Plus I will continue monthly contributions of 400 EUR. Would it be a smart Idea to combine this with the Wheel strategy? I was thinking I could sell covered calls to help lower the cost basis and have the calls expire a couple of days ex dividend. On the inverse sell puts expiring just before ex dividend. 

As I understand it my risks are:
Default on loans
KO stock price tanks when I hold it.
I cap my potential upside.

However I will always get dividend (European Option if possible) 
By running a wheel it should accelerate the snowball effect.

I'd appreciate any thoughts you have on DJT. This is NOT meant to have anything to do with politics, so please don't tell me why DJT should or should not get elected. I'm just trying to think though the analysis of what happens if he does or doesn't, as it relates to the enterprise value of DJT.  
  
Thanks  
  
  
  
Investment Thesis – DJT  
  
Based on the premise that the primary value of Truth Social is derived from the active presence of President Trump (and you can refute that assumption), I see two potential outcomes for DJT based on the Presidential election:  
  
1 – President Trump does not get re-elected. In this scenario, the value of Truth Social declines materially, as his influence wanes, and the audience becomes increasingly limited. The value of revenue from advertising declines, and never meets the threshold required to maintain current enterprise values.  
  
2 – President Trump is re-elected. In this scenario, his use of Truth Social may be limited by the fact that his continued use leads to his own financial benefit (his use of the website attracts other users, and therefore advertisers who drive revenue).  
  
Any ‘official’ pronouncements on the site (as he had made on Twitter) would have to be available from other social media, else he would be supporting a monopoly on official acts.  
  
Advertisements would not be allowed to be associated with the President’s “Truths” (as entries are called on that platform), lest corruption be evident.  
  
Potentially, any advertisements would be problematic, as they could be the source of corruption to garner favor with the President (as he is the majority owner, therefore most of the earnings go to him). Advertisers will therefore stay away (as they even might during the Presidential election season).  
  
I view this as two believable ways that DJT will decline materially in value, and I don’t see many scenarios in which it increases (or even lives up to) it’s current valuation.

Do employers know if you're holding company stock for the long haul? Do they care? Does it ever make anyone 'look better' to hold onto company stock?"|0.73|16.0|0.0|16.0

This is to both maximize my gains in a way that I don’t have to manage (I am fine paying the expense ratio not to manage dealing with T-bills), and also lower my state income tax.

I am curious what the risk to the NAV price is if there was a run on any of these ETFs, where everybody was trying to liquidate at once. If the NAV dropped, could people then theoretically purchase it at a lower price and try to get capital gains as it grows back up to its standard principal?

I am not worried about the underlying assets being defaulted on...since that would mean much bigger problems are occuring if the US is defaulting...I am meaning specifically about the NAV price.

I am mostly just trying to get assurances that if I put such a large portion of my own personal assets in these funds, that I should not have to worry."|0.57|2.0|0.0|2.0

# Let’s Start With The Macroeconomics

1. **Coffee Growth in China**: The coffee market in China is growing at a CAGR of between 9.8% ([here](https://marketingtochina.com/coffee-franchise-in-china-why-is-it-working/)) and 22% ([here](https://daxueconsulting.com/coffee-in-china/)) with a current PRC TAM of $14.2bn and a projected market size of around $30bn/year by end FY2025 ([here](https://intelligence.coffee/2023/06/pacific-coffee/)). I know the CAGR forecast range is wide, but even the lowest end is double GDP growth rate and in excess of most industries in public markets. The high case is huge. The market is massive and rapidly growing.
2. **Per capita consumption is a rocket ship**: As of 2022, per capita coffee consumption was [***11 cups per year***](https://www.statista.com/topics/7311/coffee-market-in-china/#topicOverview) in Mainland China (up from 9 cups in 2021, up from [3 cups](https://www.alizila.com/china-coffee-consumption-coffee-drinking-nation/) in 2018). As of 2023 and limiting to “Tier 1 cities”, per capita consumption was [326 cups/year](https://ecommercetochina.com/coffee-industry-in-china-2/). This is compared to [***\~600 cups per year***](https://www.statista.com/chart/6088/europes-top-ten-coffee-drinking-nations/) (or more, e.g., US is 1.87 cups/day) in Western markets. Over the next 9 years, China is expected to reach the average worldwide per capita consumption level ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/read-chinas-coffee-growth-from-perspective-japan-south-paul-hai-wang/)).
3. **West = Success**: Any long-term watcher of China realizes that a large portion of the Chinese populace is susceptible to wanting to behave like the west because the west = success. Young Chinese have a strong desire to be perceived as globalized and sophisticated, and engaging in Western habits is a proxy for that. Just from my own personal experience as someone who has lived and worked in China recently, this phenomenon does not appear to be going away.
4. **Coffee is Inelastic**: Doesn’t matter if the market goes to shit, [people still need their fix.](https://www.euromonitor.com/article/demand-protects-coffee-and-tea-industries-from-inflation) Read: if Evergrande tears down the Chinese economy, people still buy coffee.
5. **Revenue in RMB**: Consensus all over the world is that China has undervalued the yuan to increase exports. Substantially all LKNCY revenue is in RMB but the ADR trades in USD. In the event of an appreciation vs the dollar, there will be upward pressure on the price from a fundamental value perspective, and upward pressure on the ADR price because of the FX exposure.

# Let’s Deal with the “Issue”

Everyone knows LKNCY defrauded the world to the tune of +$300M back \~2020 by faking revenue. However, a turnaround is a turnaround. The former executives leading the fraud were booted from the company and founded a competitor (Cotti) which is growing fast but bleeding cash. Anyone who has worked in a big enterprise know that ethics in reporting starts with the executive suite an the stockholders -- both have changed.

Moreover, LKNCY was essentially bought out of distress by Centurium Capital. Centurium was founded by David Li. Li was formerly the head of APAC for one of the preeminent PE funds in the world, Warburg Pincus, where he worked for over 14 years.

Warburg Pincus folks are sharp and the firm is the epitome of (somewhat bureaucracy-filled) high-class institutional investing. No one survives 14 years there without rigor around how to bring value to LPs. Centurium was also funded by other heavyweights: Temasek and U.S. pension fund Washington State Investment Board.

The bottom line is that China is risky and it’s rife with fraud. But this company was shoved into the limelight, bore the consequences and paid the fines, was bought by a fund of repute, and is now more likely than not producing real results. As far as Chinese companies go, this would be one of the least risky small-cap buys in my opinion.

# Let’s Continue with Fundamentals, Especially When Benchmarked Against Comps

The comps I think referenced for purposes of this analysis are $SBUX, $JDEP.AS, $RBI (for Tim Hortons), $BROS, and to a limited extent Cotti Coffee where limited information is available.

1. **Store Openings + Increasing Same-Store Revenue**: LKNCY doubled its store footprint last year. They’re looking to add another 25% of new stores this year. The new-store growth rate obliterates the comps. In addition, the new store openings, combined with the trend in increasing per capita coffee consumption (LKNCY said same-store revenue growth was \~20% in their recent annual filings), means +++ revenue opportunities.
2. **Revenue &amp; Gross Profit**: LKNCY revenue has grown at a 71.28% CAGR over the last 4 years following “The Issue”. This obliterates every comp, which range between 10-25%/year. Comps are largely competing in saturated markets where TAM is capped out. They are limited to growing revenue based on the GDP growth rate and stealing customers from each other. They aren’t competing for “net new” consumers. Those that are operating in China are doing it in a different market segment (SBUX is simply too expensive for daily consumption given average salaries). Luckin, on the other hand, is competing for “net new” consumers in a rising tide industry. There is a ton of room for growth in China. Luckin’s gross margin between 56-60% also obliterates the comps. Finally, Luckin is likely to put further downward pressure on its COGS with the opening of new “green bean” plants (other chains like SBUX has demonstrated success with this strategy). I do think that protecting profit margin will be an issue with the entrance of newer low-cost high-growth competitors like Cotti. There was a recent “race to the bottom” in China where the two companies went head to head in ridiculous promotions. But I think Cotti will run out of cash before they win this war. Also, there’s a ton of news about how shitty and inconsistent service at Cotti is. On balance LKNCY is the only reputable and well capitalized fast-growing player in this space.
3. **No Material Debt &amp; The Company Throws Off Free Cash**: Following the resolution of their convertible note issues, they have no material debt dragging on the business. They also make free cash flow rain. Go ahead and project the financials at a conservative but reasonable rate and do a DCF yourself (I did, more on that below).
4. **Ridiculous P/E**: LKNCY’s ***trailing*** P/E multiple is about 19. Comps are up in the high 20s or 30s, and these companies are GDP-tracking from a growth perspective. A profitable 70% revenue CAGR business at 19x trailing P/E? Give me a break, it’s basically free.

# Let’s Talk Momentum and Technical Catalysts

I’m not a big technical guy. One thing I do know, however, is that many large funds can’t buy OTC stocks. Luckin currently trades OTC. If Luckin were to list again on an exchange, it would open up the cap table to U.S.-based institutional investors. I can’t imagine a price pop not occurring from this eventuality, whether from increased demand or expansion in the P/E multiple.

# Things to Watch

Of course, China is one of the most competitive consumer markets in the world, and Luckin isn’t a company like NVDA innovating in a space to create a market. As a result, a lot of future developments could adversely affect company performance or stock price, and any investment in LKNCY merits at least quarterly monitoring from a fundamental and competitive perspective.

# The Only Conclusion

I built out a model forecasting the financial statements through FY2027 and did a DCF, all against the contextual backdrop (partially) summarized above, and I see present intrinsic value of \~$60 per share. I even put a sensitivity table in to toggle WACC vs perpetuity growth rate or EBITDA exit multiple, and the shittiest combination from both of the sensitivity analyses gives me $43.71/share for today’s intrinsic value.

The base case represents a +100% upside on a hypergrowth business. The discounted cash flow analysis, together with the rosy outlook for coffee in China, makes LKNCY a value investment and a growth investment at the same time, which is why I backed up the truck to load up."|0.22|0.0|0.0|0.0

Most of my salary I put into stocks, and I kind of assume that I will just use this money for retirement when the time comes.

I recently opened up a traditional 401k and a Roth 401k through work,. I've also had a Roth IRA for some time. And I have my regular brokerage account, where 95% of my money is at the moment.

How should I prioritize how much money I allocate to these different accounts. As of right now, I live with my parents and have very little overhead costs aside from my car payment and some small bills around the house, so I'm looking to allocate nearly all of my paycheck to these accounts. I know I should always max out my Roth IRA so I have done that, but I'm not totally certain how to split my money amongst the other retirement accounts, and I guess whatever's left over I'll just put into my traditional brokerage account.

A company that I really believed in missed one of their targets and their stock absolutely tanked. It is interesting because they consistently hit their targets and out performed on several of them., like eps and earning. Anyway, the stock fell under $1 and has been unable to recover and is at risk of being delisted. 

Fast forward, they just sent out a proxy vote for a reverse split, which I knew was coming. However, the ratio on vote was not really specified. It’s said either 1:5 or 1:30, to be determined at the discretion of the board. Can they do that? It seems a little shady for it to be up to the discretion of the board after voting.

He is well below the poverty line but is happy because he doesn’t want/need much.

I called him yesterday to check on him (and other family members) after the bridge collapse which is when he told me he had sold the property but now he doesn’t know what to do with the money and wants help from me determining the best course of action. 


I just want him to be able to live comfortably without me having to worry about him financially for the rest of his days. He wants to set me up to inherit something (well and a car but that’s because he enjoys sleeping in them and his current car is limping along). He also wants to move out to Ohio where my mom and I are now and would probably rather move in with one of us rather than live on his own. This is not an option because of the way he lives.

He suggested buying property, or CDs, or Gold. He is not very much interested in the stock market (trust issues) and would rather avoid as much taxes as he can on the money he has just acquired. My inclination is to have him buy property but I don’t won’t him to feel trapped (again he is a vagabond at heart). I love precious metals but that isn’t going to help put food on the table or a roof over his head as they are a LONG term investment. 


So my question to you all is, how can 300-500k be invested without the stock market to aid my father in living a comfortable life for his last 10-20 years? 


TLTR: my dad is a vagabond who now has ~400k in money and wants help knowing what to do with it.

This morning I accidentally contributed a small amount of money directly to my Roth. I haven’t invested it into anything, it’s just sitting in the account. 

My understanding is that unless I want to avoid the 6% excise tax on it, I should file a recharacterization request to move that money into my traditional IRA, and then execute a rollover back into my Roth.

t3_1bomwr2|1711496116.0|investing|A Fundamental Analysis For a Bull Case on Nokia|"# Here's why I believe there is a bull case for Nokia:

1. **Historical Performance and Restructuring:** Nokia has historically faced challenges with sub-par revenue performance, leading to declines in stock price. However, the company's commitment to restructuring indicates proactive efforts to address underlying issues and improve efficiency.
2. **Cost Cutting Measures:** Nokia has implemented cost-cutting measures, aiming to reduce expenses by $1 billion. These measures are expected to enhance profitability by decreasing operational costs and increasing income.
3. **Investment in 6G Technology:** Nokia's significant investment in the development of 6G technology positions it as a frontrunner in the telecommunications sector. This commitment to innovation presents opportunities for future revenue growth and market leadership. 4. Strong Financial Position: Analysis of Nokia's balance sheet reveals a healthy financial position, with a higher cash balance compared to debt. This financial stability provides flexibility for strategic investments and expansion initiatives.
4. **Low Risk Perception:** Relative to other tech stocks in the industry, Nokia is perceived as a low-risk investment. This perception is based on factors such as stable financials, diversified revenue streams, and established market presence.
5. **Strategic Leadership and Talent Acquisition:** Nokia's appointment of Derek Urbaniak, an experienced leader in silicon engineering, signals a strategic move to bolster its technical capabilities. This, along with corporate restructuring, indicates a promising outlook under new leadership.
6. **Market Analyst Consensus:** Despite short-term fluctuations, market analysts widely believe that Nokia's fair value exceeds its current stock price. This consensus suggests potential undervaluation in the market, presenting an opportunity for investors to capitalize on future growth.

# TLDR;

*Nokia's bull case rests on its proactive restructuring efforts, investment in cutting-edge technology, strong financial position, low-risk perception, strategic leadership decisions, and consensus among market analysts regarding its undervaluation. These factors collectively indicate a promising outlook for the company and potential for substantial growth in the future.*"|0.62|6.0|0.0|6.0

But I do acknowledge that due to the rate of innovation, we will see this barrier broken. And while my hesitancy in investing in a megacap stock stems from my original thought process, it fails to consider that…who’s to say in 10-20 years the market cap of these companies isn’t 10T. Which opens the door for thought about how much companies can grow in the future. My original thinking is a 1T company might grow to 3T, implying a 300% increase. So I wanted to find companies that would have a much easier time growing from a 50B company to a 300 or 500B company. Or a 2B company growing to a 35B. "|0.38|0.0|0.0|0.0

I'm considering a investment and would appreciate your insights. Currently, my family and I own portions of a three-story house. Here's the breakdown:  
  
The first floor, which includes a garage and a basic kitchen/living space (totaling 80m²), has potential for conversion into a full living area.  
Above this, the second floor, also 80m², comprises a complete living space with two rooms, a balcony, a hallway, a living room with kitchen, and a bathroom.  
My parents own the third floor and the attic (same layout as second floor).  
The opportunity arises as the lady that is living on the first two floors is looking to sell, asking price: €45,000.  
  
Financially, I'm in a favorable position, thanks to a new job that nets me $3,000 monthly—a solid income by local standards. The plan involves my father purchasing the property through a bank loan, with an estimated monthly repayment of around €180. We aim to rent it out for approximately €200 per month. However, acquiring the loan requires a €8,000 down payment. I'm prepared to contribute half (€4,000), with my parents covering the remaining amount. Although the property would be in my father's name, it's understood that I would inherit it in the future. I'd like for your guys opinion as this is a big deal for me (23M) and don't want to make a bad investment for the future. I currently live in another town - couple hours away - might live here forever but probably not. I'd help out with the rent until we find tenants.

But after about 20 years of postponing and half-assed attempts, I finally put together a good investment tracker in Excel. 

A few key points:

\- I know enough VBA to be dangerous, but I decided to keep it simple and avoid any VBA (also I use a Mac and not all VBA functions are available).

\- Each investment has its own tab. This goes against the grain of data manipulation convention, but I started this way 20 years ago, and wanted to leverage my previous efforts. It gave me a few hiccups along the way, but I learned a few things.

\- I have a performance dashboard, a tax dashboard and a dividend calculator. Most of my investment accounts are in the US, but I live in the EU and have to calculate dividends / capital gains a bit differently, and I like having that on its own tab. I also compare the potential tax I would owe in the US to that of my residence country.

\- While XIRR is a powerful function, I have found that good ol' (Total Return+1)\^(1/N)-1 (where N is number of years held) gives me the same annualized return figure to within three decimal places. So on each tab I'm running both this formula and XIRR just for my own information.

\- I'm tracking returns both with and without dividends, for those holdings that pay them.

\- I placed a lot of focus on making data entry easy. I can simply cut from my accounts online and dump into a table on each holding tab. Moving forward, I'll probably do this 2 to 3 times / year.

\- Excel's stock data retrieval is convienient, so if I obtain a new position, I can simply create a new tab, enter the ticker symbol, the date I purchased, # of shares and basis. The spreadsheet does the rest.

\- The last thing I need to do is add total return &amp; annualized return for the entire portfolio. I'll probably use XIRR for that, but I'm in no rush... tracking total and annualized return for each individual holding is more informative for me.

I am unable to wrap my head around this and would like to hear your thoughts on this.  
Basically, should I invest locally with great potential upside then the US, (although with a higher risk as in the country defaulting or struggling even more !?), when I intend to hold my investments for a long period of time (10-20 years).

Context:

\- I am from a country where low-risk investment in the local market yields a 20% return on average.   
\- barely 0.01% of the population invests in stock so even in a struggling economy, medium to high-risk investments in the biggest companies of the country have a huge upside (far above the 20% mark) since the knowledge is now spreading at faster pace which means more money will flow into business.  
\- The country is running on IMF plans and political and economic uncertainties and inflation remain at an all-time high.  


Considering the above factors, I have been able to invest a huge amount in US stocks and ETFs.  
My concerns are that:  
\- Inflation in the US is barely 3%+ but I do not live in the US and my earnings and investments are in dollars. whereas inflation and interest rates are 20%+ locally.   
\- The Economy of the US is much much more stable (obviously) than where I live. But the returns that are possible locally are also in a local currency. Struggling countries do not let you easily take the money out in a foreign currency for the possiblity of moving elsewhere in future (I understand that it's not entirely impossible)"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

What?|"I've read a dozen of thread titled ""Should I take a personal loan for investing?"", and another dozen titled ""Should I pay off mortgage early or invest?"" (on this sub and the adjacent ones) and I really don't get the discrepancy in responses between these two.

The general consensus for the first one is that you should not take a personal loan for investing: even though, the past performance of the most ETFs shows higher returns than the interest on the loan, anything might happen in the future, and the consequences might be hard to recover from, with which I personally agree.

On the other side, nearly everyone recommends paying mortgage as late as possible and invest, because the expected gains from the market are greater than the mortgage rate. Hm.

I just don't get it. What's the difference between mortgage and a personal loan in this context? Is it that the mortgage rates tend to be a few percent lower than the personal loan rates? Okay, but if the market crashes, these few percent won't matter much. Is it because the mortgage loan is protected by the house? Well, if I were to give my house away, I've already failed hard.

So, is this double-thinking a product of shared misconceptions and stereotypes, or it has some logic behind?

Seeing bitcoin fluctuations almost directly follow with BTC I had an idea that I wanted to chat about.  

Buying long Coinbase puts, say 1 year out minimum, looking more towards 1.5 years. 

-the most overvalued large cap stock based on p/e, sales and book value. 
- analyst projections of growth rates are minimal
- volatility probably hasn’t even peaked yet either, speculating here though. 

Potentially more run time before the top, but even that said, it most likely will collapse below current prices. 

I don’t hang around any sort of crypto stuff, knowledgeable on the halving, or even know estimates of what people think it’s gonna run till.

I'm curious what you think about continuing to hold well-performing insurance stocks, even though a turnaround in interest rates is expected this year.

Since the pandemic, I've held shares in Axa, Allianz and Munich RE. And they all make a significant portion of their profits through low-risk capital gains. As someone who has studied International Finance, I know that a low-interest rate environment is theoretically not optimal for insurance companies, as they have to take on more risk to achieve the same return. But how will this affect the share price in practical terms? I mean, I assume this is already priced into the current share price.   
I'm just curious what you would do.

I am grateful for any constructive advice!

The reason Reddit's stats looked so great towards the end of 2023 really comes down to one thing, Google has loved them some Reddit in all of their recent updates

As Google has done its best to crush as many niche sites, blogs, local newspapers, and other similar smaller sites over all of its recent updates Reddit has been one of the biggest gainers (if not the biggest) along with Yelp, Quora, TripAdvisor, and a handful of other sites that have been around forever and acquired billions of incoming backlinks

For the longest time Google didn't really like user generated content, particularly forums like Reddit, that isn't the case anymore

&amp;#x200B;

So the question becomes, what does this mean for the future?

My whole life has revolved around SEO and the Google search results for the majority of the last decade

I think it would be silly to expect this to revert, and personally I think Google is doing its best to 'get rid of' as many sites as possible so when they go full AI results there are less people/businesses complaining

If one day they just switched from the 2015 results where (for the most part) the best content won and there was actually variety in the serps to AI results then tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands would have a legit beef

But if instead they have slowly removed as many sites as they have removed and then do it, far fewer can make any kind of a complaint

If we all went from $X,XXX earnings to nothing overnight it would be an uproar

If they slowly do it after removing 90%+ of the smaller sites then really only the CEO's of Reddit, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Quora will have a beef.... much easier to deal with a few than everybody

&amp;#x200B;

IMO Google Search is dying, they don't care about it and are going to replace it as quickly as possible

People are turning to stuff like ChatGPT which is only going to happen more as it gets better

We don't live in a 10 blue link dominated world anymore, at least we won't for long

And to me pretty much all of the positive metrics for Reddit's growth come down to 1 thing, they got a huge short term boost by getting so much more exposure in that dying 10 blue link landscape

&amp;#x200B;

If you notice I have said absolutely nothing negative about Reddit in this post, I don't know their business plans, I don't know anything about the company

But I think their IPO came at the absolute perfect time for their CEO's, and I would be very very cautious putting money into something that looks great today because of something that may not be the case tomorrow

When I first learned about finance I was taught about Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).
I was taught we can use the S&amp;P 500 CAGR to compare how an investment has performed compared to ""the market.""

My brokerage shows my rate of return using Internal Rate of Return (IRR). I was incredibly happy to see 17+% rate of return but when I found out this is IRR instead of CAGR, I am a little lost on how to compare performance (as 17% IRR seems to be lower returns than 17% CAGR).

How can one compare their IRR Performance to a benchmark showing CAGR?"|0.72|6.0|0.0|6.0

After plummeting through most of 2023, US core inflation has rebounded recently (on a sequential basis). With new data in hand, Goldman Sachs Research raised its forecast for core PCE for the fourth quarter of 2024 back to 2.4%, roughly where it stood last fall, writes Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs' Chief Economist, in the team's report. Our economists also shaved their forecast for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year from four to three.  
  
Even so, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that the US economy is still poised for a soft landing — meaning a return to 2% inflation without a recession. Recent growth and employment numbers have reinforced our economists' view that the supply-demand imbalances in the economy are abating. Favorable weather is part of the reason for February's strong jobs report, and the January figures were revised lower. A slowdown in wage growth suggests that the recent rebound in services inflation is likely to reverse.    
  
An immigration surge is a key reason Goldman Sachs Research expects the labor market to rebalance smoothly, despite strong GDP growth and rapid payroll gains. Our economists estimate that net immigration last year was about 1.5 million people above the long-term trend. The surge in immigration is expected to increase US GDP growth and helps explain the recent rise in the unemployment rate (from 3.4% in April 2023 to 3.9% in February 2024).  
  
Goldman Sachs Research expects the Fed — as well as the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada — to begin cutting rates in June. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, decided this week to end its negative interest rate policy and other exceptional policy measures. Even so, our economists' long-term view on BOJ policy remains dovish. They point out that real GDP contracted in the second half of 2023 and the tracking estimate for first-quarter growth is “marginally negative.” "|0.32|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_1blvb2a|1711208865.0|investing|Can someone please explain why DWAC with a current market cap of 1.37 billion would be worth 4 billion after the merger with TS?|"Lots of financial sites are using the 4 billion number so obviously it's my mistake, I'm not denying that. Here's what I'm thinking, so hopefully someone can show me my mistake. 

My reasoning is based on the fact that the number of shares generally doesn't affect the market cap. If a company has a 4:1 stock split, the number of shares quadruples but the market cap certainly doesn't.

DWCA is a shell company, and it's valuation is based entirely on the assumption that it will merge with TS. If that merger falls through somehow then DWCA would go to zero.

So the current market cap of DWCA is a proxy for what shareholders think TS is worth. If someone owns 1% of DWCA (3 million shares), they're hoping to end up owning 1% of TS after the merger.

So 1% of the current DWAC market cap is 137 million (1% of 1.37 billion), meaning 1% of TS is implicitly valued at 137 million. If the merger happened right now they would own 1% of TS, no matter how many shares that's divided up into.

Owning 1% of TS with 3 million shares and owning 1% of TS with 12 million shares (or a billion or whatever) still just means they own 1% of TS.

What am I missing?


EDIT:

There are three derivatives on my broker: warrants, knock-outs and factor certificates. I know how the individual products work and that they have their own advantages and disadvantages. Warrants/options with the theta decay and the dependence on IV, knock-outs with the defined knock-out threshold and the leverage that is diluted/increased when the derivative rises/falls in value and the decreasing value for sideway movement in the case of factor certificates, etc.  
So far so good. However, I still don't understand when to trade which derivative. I mean, at the end of the day, they are all derivatives with which I can bet on price changes in a leveraged way and thus make similar or equal profits with all three derivatives. The only big difference I see is that the products are priced with different levels of complexity. From a simple multiplication to the Black Scholes model.

I am coming with what I think is an unconventional situation as I googled this question but honestly cant seem to find an answer anywhere.  


I am planning on buying a home soon and will need 3% down for the purchase, my goal here is to save up 12k as fast as possible which shouldnt be too difficult.   


My plan: Put xxxx amount of money per paycheck into my brokerage account as a way of storing my money there (I am too impulsive to keep it in my savings or checking account, this is a different issue I am working on lol). Say in 6 months I have 12k which would mostly be my contributions and maybe a tiny bit of growth, for example keeping in SPAXX or buying SCHD would have a small yield in 6mo and maybe even a loss but thats besides the point. When I pull this money out and sell my spaxx or schd, is this now considered capital gains tax on the full 12k? would it be only on any slight earnings I made?   


Please let me know if this is a terrible plan due to tax implications or if this is a good idea of locking away and saving money for an impulse buyer?"|0.55|1.0|0.0|1.0

Quick question --

I purchase VEQT for the same set amount biweekly on a Friday (I have it set for auto- purchase).

I've been doing this for some time now.

I'm wondering if purchasing VEQT weekly on a Friday (with the amount equalling out to the same biweekly/monthly) would make much a difference long term as far as dollar cost averaging goes?

Or should I just stick to what I've been doing as changing it up would be negligible.

""It depends on your tax rate now, vs your tax rate when you retire.""

My thoughts:

A work sponsored 401k is pre tax, and a ROTH IRA is post tax (grows tax free). 

Wouldn't it basically always be better to pay tax now and not have to pay taxes on the growth (Roth IRA) vs paying tax later on withdrawal (401k)?

Let's say in both cases I have $5k to invest today.  If I put that in the 401k, I would invest the full 5k but then pay taxes on the maybe 100k it's worth at withdrawal.

If I instead did the Roth IRA, I would only have what's leftover after paying taxes to invest (maybe 3k), but I won't have to pay taxes on the maybe $95k it's worth at withdrawal.

Am I misunderstanding this?

I can’t wrap my head around what is the mart thing to do for his case scenario. He’s older, not much in savings, has a house payment, etc. but I at least want him to have some type of cushion saved up.

Evaluating business/stock is one of my fun hobbies. I am a conservative and cautious investor (no yolos). I love stock investment, company strategy evaluation write-ups, corporate balance sheet analysis, options trading, real estate investment, doing write-ups evaluating companies, etc.  I would LOVE to take a 1-2 year hiatus from corporate America and try doing something like this full time at some point for a year or two and make it into a formal company. I know some individuals are full-time in managing their own portfolio (i.e ""family office""), and some are full time day traders. However, I am not looking for this. I want to start something and kind of just see where it can go while perfectly understanding it's all a very competitive space.  If nothing, it can be on my resume as I started an investment company."|0.44|0.0|0.0|0.0

Why not put everything into Nasdaq100?     Tech stocks could crash for a long time... but how likely is that.  Tech is going to keep growing more and more isn't it.

Reason I created the graph was because I have £400k in the Fisher fund, which has actually outperformed the S&amp;P500 (if my calculations are correct).

So I'm wondering if I should:

a. Put £400k into Nasdaq100

b. Leave £250k in Fisher (the minimum allowed)  and put £150k in Nasdaq100

Fisher keep calling me and telling me I'm mad, but if Nasdaq keeps getting 20% gain per year vs Fisher's 10% then in 10 years I'll be millions better off. ( I would like to retire in 10 years lol, when I'm 60)

A few months ago I started taking investing seriously. 
A year ago, I had nearly $100k in cash in a hysa and only about $15k invested.
Today, I have nearly $100k invested and $80k in cash in the HYSA thorough diligent saving and investing. 

Over the past several months, i've been dollar cost averaging big blocks of money money from the HYSA into the S&amp;P 500. 

My goal was to hit $100k invested by age 30, and with my birthday next week, I can say I hit that goal. Once I reached that figure, I was going to pay my mortgage down ($220,000 @3.5%).

I am also considering dumping everything but
$1,000 into the markets to have a clean slate at age 30. It would be cool to look back in 20 years and say ""yeah when I was 30 I had everything invested but $1,000."" That would mean dumping another $80k in. It would bring my stock S&amp;P fund up to $180,000, with $170,000 of funds invested in just the last 6-8 months. Then the next few years I can pay down the house or invest more. It would also be cool to have a paid off mortgage by around age 32 so may stop at the $100k like originally planned. I know the saying is, would you borrow money from your house to invest? And if the answer is no then don’t do it.. 

I also don’t plan on staying where I’m at more than another 5 years most likely (but don’t know) 
I'm kind of stuck between several options at this point...

Edit: After reading many of your comments it appears to me that a smart way of going about this would be to have a number that helps me sleep at night and cover all of my bills in the near term 3-12 months of expenses ($50k cap is what I think would be that) and then invest everything beyond that. 

If I do decide to buy a different house in 5 years, or when my life changes, I can always increase that number at that time ahead of that purchase, but there doesn’t seem to be any reason to rush to save more than $50k in the hysa and a 3.5% loan is too low to pay off. "|0.78|248.0|0.0|248.0

However, I'm also questioning whether this approach is sustainable in the long term. Recently, I enrolled in an HDHP and became eligible for an HSA. Additionally, I still have until April 15th to contribute to or max out my Roth IRA. After crunching some numbers, it seems feasible for me to max out all three accounts if I manage my budget carefully.

Then there's this other account that my friend, who is a financial advisor, signed me up for three years ago. He mentioned it's a retirement account, but when I log in, it doesn't explicitly state that it's for retirement—it just says 'life paid at 99.' Over the past three years, I've contributed $120 per month, totaling $4,320. 

I earn $52,000 annually, and my monthly expenses include $500 for rent, $150 for food, and $300 for gas and insurance, leaving me with only $100 if I decide to contribute to all three accounts—HSA, IRA, and 401k. I already have $30,000 in savings.

Given this context, does it sound like a life insurance policy? Can I halt contributions and wait several years before cashing out to at least break even? I can provide further details if necessary.

Upon reaching out to my former advisor, Rob, for clarification, I asked whether it's worthwhile for me to maintain this arrangement. I mentioned my account's current balance of $1,200 despite having contributed $4,200.

Rob's response was: ""Yes, it is worth maintaining because it's designed for retirement.

Also in that case, if I know I will be paying $15000 in taxes, can someone just strategically put their money in really risky investments and if they lose they can just easily write it all off as if they didn’t lose anything?|0.17|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_1bk35kd|1711016029.0|investing|Why is the ask price much, much higher (60%) than the stock price at last close?|"Hi everyone. I've noticed a few stocks I want to buy lately will show an ask price that is wayyyy higher than the ""stock"" price (the price at close). I've I have a general understanding of the bid-ask spread, but my question is how could such a major spread be possible?

I use Schwab for trading. And I am overseas so I'm typically looking at stocks after hours, setting up orders at a limit price once the market opens when I'm confident, and other times just waiting til the market opens to place a trade.  
For example, I'm looking at $MTX, which was $74.50 at last close, but the ask price is $118.45. That is about 60% higher than the last price!

I assume that this is just happening because it's after hours, but is that right? Hypothetically, if I place an order at limit price would it really execute at $118.45 when the market opens? What about if I set the order at market price?

Would love some info about what's happening here, and any advice about what to do/not do in a situation like this. Thanks very much!"|0.4|0.0|0.0|0.0
t3_1bk2e8q|1711012793.0|investing|Is SOFI oversold, discussion also on what's going on as it is one of my investments and I'd like an outside opinion|"So, about mid feb-march sofi announced its first quarterly profit, resulting in the stock price shooting up to 9 dollars from the 7-8 range. Not long after that, however, the company announced a capital raise of 600$ million that would potentially be financed by the sale of shares in 2029. However, at current prices after the huge drop the valuation is still over 6$ billion so this still would be less than 10% of the companys valuation. (Note the stock is also currently trading at under 7$ at time of posting). Here's the part on my thesis:  
  
Although the company is now profitable, and will probably continue to be, the board was aware that the announcement of raising this capital had the potential to drop the price a lot. They knew this, and instead of doing the proper thing of explaining what the capital raising was for, decided to publish no info on that and profit off of the share price dropping so massively as a result of no real announcement about what this huge amount of funding was for. They also have made no efforts to reassure investors about why this is good for the company (which is very easy for them to do even if they just said the money was for a big expansion and didn't specify what to keep their plans safe). They probably sold a lot of shares prior to this announcement or profited off the information some other way by letting others sell before hand. It has been a few weeks now since this announcement and there has been complete silence from the board. Also, since a lot of banks and finance companies are starting to notice SOFI as a competitor the stock is probably very oversold as well since these competitors also will publish bad news and give poorer ratings to the stock (a lot of the older banks and such have their own stock analysts, etc that would be able to do this).  
  
In short, I think the stock is currently very oversold, the management are allowing this to happen for some reason, but at some point in the near future, possibly next earnings if it is also profitable, this will have to end. So, the shorts will probably be squeezed out before the next quarter report unless the management have found a way to make it slightly unprofitable through some one off investments/expenditures or accounting that shifts the profit to the quarter after that. Still, I'd rate this stock as a very good long term gamble at current prices that are somehow lower than the price before the company became profitable last quarter.  
  
What are your thoughts on this theory, or is this kind of huge reaction to a relatively small raising of funds by a company after the first ever profitable quarter normal?"|0.2|0.0|0.0|0.0

Do they have a big rally?|"The Federal Reserve is in the news again.  At their latest meeting yesterday they kept interest rates the same but all signs are pointing to the 1st cut in rates, in the near future.

When the Fed does start to cut rates, which stock sectors benefit the most?  According to an article in [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sector-etfs-benefit-fed-rate-150000520.html), the following sectors are the top candidates:

* Real Estate
* Utilities
* Homebuilders
* Consumer Discretionary (hotels, restaurants, automobiles etc)
* Technology

What about stocks in general?  How do they fare when interest rates start getting cut?  The answer to that according to an article in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-02/what-happens-to-markets-when-the-fed-cuts-interest-rates?embedded-checkout=true) is, depends.  The article reviewed the last 22 rate cut cycles going back to 1928 and found the following:

* A 17% average gain over the next 12 months if there was not a recession at the time of the cuts or during the next 12 months.
* A 8% average gain over the next 12 months if there was a recession.

If a ['soft landing'](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp) is in our future we may have a strong market over the next 12 months.

I just maxed it out. I plan on really just getting a handful of etfs just to keep it simple (VOO or VTI mainly, a bit in VTUS, and maybe a bit in something more volatile just because I have time on my side). That being said, I always get overwhelmed whenever I’m about to actually buy into those etfs, and then I don’t end up buying it because of it. How do you not get so overwhelmed?

My main thing is basically timing. I’ve heard people say that you should just invest because time in the market always beats timing the market. I see how that makes sense and I do intend to not do the whole trading and timing once I’m in. The thing is that I’m not technically “in” yet because I have nothing invested yet. I simply just funded my account. 

I know I should probably just start investing, but I’m always somehow concerned about timing my entrance because “what if I enter at too high of a price and I don’t make as much in the long term because I couldn’t wait X amount of time when prices became lower.” Basically, it’s “what if prices fall in a couple of months so I can then buy more shares to hold long term.” It doesn’t help that some people say that the world will fall apart within the next 5 minutes while others say that this is the start to a boom (I’m exaggerating a bit here).

How are they doing currently?  
$MNY reported a considerable increase in approved applications by over 80% for Q4 2023, which contributed to a revenue jump of more than 50% year-over-year from US$17.2 million in Q4’22. In terms of performance this is all very positive for the company.  
What does the near future look like for them?  
The Company stated that they anticipate year-over-year revenue growth of at least 60% in Singapore and 50% in Hong Kong for the month of January 2024.

How do they plan to grow?  
MoneyHero has plans to boost its recruitment efforts, aiming to expand its team across various departments, including engineering, technology, marketing, sales, finance, and operations.  
The company attributes its growth to its “commitment to connecting consumers with a variety of financial products” and its ability to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.  
To quote one of their representatives I connected with on Linkedin, ""We are implementing a digital transformation, underscored by the launch of a new AI-driven personal finance tool, promises to deliver tailored financial advice, ensuring that MoneyHero remains at positive momentum. Our goal is to continue to grow, and set our paths towards profitability in the near future""

Lastly, do you typically factor in social security income into your retirement plan? I’m calculating how much I need to invest monthly to reach retirement, but I’m not sure if social security is typically included in the calculation - or what a SS payout would even amount to.

Here’s what I’ve been ruminating over: 

My wife and I have two children, my brother and his wife have two children. Each family has one special needs child. All the kids are very young, so it’s hard to project exactly what will happen, but there is a good chance the two special needs children will never be able to live by themselves or take care of themselves. 

This places a burden on us as parents, no doubt, but one we are happy and willing to take on as any parent would. However, if something should happen to us, the care of our special needs kids will fall to other family members OR their siblings if they are adults. 

I don’t want to say that’s “unfair,” but it’s something I would like to plan for and mitigate financially, today, if I can. We are not wealthy people, but we can afford to put a little back each month in index funds. 

I’m looking for advice on whether or not it would be beneficial to pool our funds together in an investment partnership for this purpose. There does seem to be some tax benefit, of course, but I’m wondering if there is some other more efficient path. 

Another consideration I’ve had (in favor of the partnership structure) is that I could theoretically hand control to one of our more capable children if they show interest and the ability to manage the fund.

t3_1bjab2x|1710930773.0|investing|Self investing fundamentals|"Best practices:

1. Invest a consistent amount from salary (e.g. get paid weekly, take 10% minimum of after tax income to invest)

2. Invest any windfalls to the maximum possible (e.g. receive a bonus, if that cash is not pencilled for debt reduction or other necessity, invest it all)

3. Invest at least half of any persistent income increase (e.g. you've been earning 100 after tax, and investing 10 with take home of 90, and now receive a 20 pay rise. Start investing 20 so take home is 100 but now investing amount is doubled and lifestyle creep is more muted)

4. Invest in tax advantaged vehicles (e.g. salary sacrifice in some jurisdictions can be pre-tax, some jurisdictions have tax free vehicles for post-tax contributions, some bonds have tax free interest, some investments can be tax free or the interest on loans for those investments tax deductible, etc.)

5. Decide your risk tolerance and investment time horizon (e.g. the thought of being down 10% scares you, the stock market may not be for you or you may need to wind back any leverage; you need the money in 3 years, you may need some bond ladder allocation; etc )

6. Decide the portfolio's asset allocation given risk appetite and time horizon (e.g. there may be some allocation to equities, some allocation to bonds, some allocation to real estate, some allocation to private equity, some allocation to commodities, some allocation to speculative assets like crypto or collectibles, etc.)

7. For any allocation, decide on the vehicle, considering access costs (e.g. want to access bonds - a bond ETF may be the cheapest and most liquid mechanism; want to access private equity - an investment trust or private equity house like KKR might be the way to access; want to access equities - direct purchasing may work from a dollar cost perspective but ETFs might be better from a time cost and concentration risk perspective, etc.)

8. If sourcing any investment yourself ensure you are at least a well informed as the other side of the transaction (e.g. if investing in start ups through an investment platform like seedrs to act as your private equity allocation? make sure you are performing the quality of due diligence that you would expect to see on Shark Tank type show; if investing in residential real estate for rental income, get the structural engineer and the lawyer, etc. and don't rely on the sales pitch about the location; if investing in stocks, know your meme or know your investing style if investing in individual names - what's the story, where's the value, what's the catalyst; what's the probability; etc.)

Once those foundations are well known, investing takes care of itself, almost...

You got another 10? Or 20 after the pay rise? Or 60 after some payout? Or 5 after a dividend? Okay, what's your current allocation versus your target allocation? Which asset class needs a top up? This will help you buy (relatively) low as you will tend to buy relatively underperforming asset classes over time

You get some news on one of your holdings: is it good or bad? Is the story over or reinforced? Is the thesis broken or complicated or strengthened? Is there a red flag or is the sniff test failing? Is your investment style being compromised? (value stock above your estimate of intrinsic by more than your guide sell price, momentum stick losing momentum, quality stock writing off acquisitions' goodwill, management changing strategy in a way you don't understand or can't countenance,  etc.) Is a fund's or ETF's AUM reducing our investment style changing? Is there a corporate action coming up? These may all trigger sales or reductions or additions to holdings. 

And those decisions should be made within the constraints of the portfolio construction and allocation principles driven by your time horizon and risk tolerance over time

Finally for every asset class, you should have some principles you follow, such as knowing the triggers that will force you to get out on the downside (e.g. government regulation of the asset class or the investment vehicle used for that asset class, management malpractice, etc.) and the level at which you will trim on the upside (to what level do you let any one investment run - some might be coffee-canned while some might be done after running up 30% in 3 months)"|0.6|5.0|0.0|5.0

You may be surprised to learn that only 10% of retirees have over a million dollars in savings.  Additionally, the average retirement savings by age:

&amp;#x200B;

* $426,000 for those aged 65 to 74
* $357,000 for those aged 75 and older

These numbers are very concerning.  What are investors doing wrong that causes this shortfall for so many people?  In my view, the number one cause of not saving enough for retirement is not having a budget that keeps spending below income.  This takes discipline and requires a person to delay large purchases until the budget allows.  That is hard for many to do.

If the retiree has been diligent in investing in the stock market over their lifetime but still comes up short, it is likely because they did not follow a long term buy and hold strategy with broad based USA stock ETF's.  The temptation to try to time the market cycles by selling when things are looking bad and trying to buy back later is just too great for many to resist.   Nobody can time the market consistently.

That would be how to pay the loan back BESIDES selling the securities at a later date(and just paying it back in general without paying taxes first). I understand you can sell years later and pay the loan back but my first question is, wouldn’t that mean you’d pay capital gains tax on that amount sold Before you go to pay that loan.

Secondly if my securities have dividends, can I use those to directly pay the loan without paying Tax on those dividends? Long story short, how do you pay back that loan without triggering capital gains taxes? If you sell securities you pay tax… dividends will require you to pay tax too… unless ofcourse if you’re using the money from the proceeds to directly pay the loan and that somehow doesn’t count towards capital gains tax? 

Never understood how that worked in the fine print when it came down to paying the loan, hope someone can help me understand. "|0.67|1.0|0.0|1.0

the market.   


As you may, or may not know, many stocks are in the red for the past week or so, or at least had big plunges of about \~5-8%. The indexes growth has been also stunted. 

  
 The news claims this is due to the people's fear that the interest rates might not be cut by(or in) June of 2024. Question is, why would there be such mentality among the people, when last year, although a deflation was present, in the months September to December we saw average inflation percentage of   
around 3.5%, and yet no one even mentioned it on the news, stocks kept growing. 

As of now, the inflation is about on average 3.15% and yet people seem distressed regarding it, at least according to the news.   


Math shows that the current inflation compared to late 2023 is about 0.85 PP(percentage points) down, or in percentage that would be -10%.  Another comparison could be with March 2023 when the inflation was a staggering 5% and it is by now, down by 3 PP or 37%, and yet we had a bullish run back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rate cuts? Sure, they seem impossible, because the Fed's target hasn't been met. But that does not necessarily mean a recession or a big increase in rates, because like I mentioned, you can also go and check out the chart for 2023, although it was a deflation, inflation did not seem to be at a very favourable level either.

Then they are effectively putting 50% of their investment money into the riskier investment of stocks and 50% into the more conservative investment of the bond market. Assuming there isn't a huge downturn, the stock growth will outpace the bond growth and, eventually, this person's portfolio will be a 60/40 asset value percentage. With even more time, it may even become a 70/30 or an 80/20 with the same 50/50 buying allocation.

So my question is, why do people rebalance their portfolios to maintain the percentage of their asset values (in this case, the person would sell VOO and buy more BND) when the person has already been placing their money into the investments with the intended split.

And even if you wanted to attempt to maintain the initial percentage allocations you started out with, wouldn't it be better to just adjust how much of each you buy in the future? like buying $80 of bonds and $20 of stocks when it gets too far out of wack? Even with that strategy, if your portfolio value is too high, then the growth of the money in VOO would outpace the amount of BND you are buying even when buying 100% BND... and then at that point you are no longer even investing into the fastest growing asset anymore.

**GOOD TO KNOW**  
  
\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- They have invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue.  
  
It remains to be seen if they will succeed in mass adoption in Taiwan and if they are able to execute successful international expansion but at least sustainability megatrend is support them. Based on the stock market volume this is a forgotten company at the moment and big moves can be expected if more interest arise. Naturally the main focus will remain in their performance.

t3_1bhn9cv|1710756886.0|investing|Better to take a loan or a loss?|"I'm trying to get my head around how my mother can best finance a development project. She's in New Zealand but I think that's beside the point and this just about the maths and the fundamentals of investing I think.

She currently has about 800,000ish invested through a management company and this is fairly semi-liquid, they have advised she can access it as cash within days/weeks if need.

She is in the process of carving off 5 sections/plots/lots from her property to sell as self-build plots and needs 400,000 to complete the various engineering works (sewer, power, land clearing, fencing etc).

Her bank has offered her a development loan at 8.4%, interest-only, for the whole 400,000 over 2 years. Which by my calculations is 67,200 total interest over the 2 years, assuming she draws on that loan all at once and it takes the full 2 years to pay back. So 67,200 of direct cost to the project.

Why doesn't she use her own invested funds you ask? That's what we're trying to decide too. I'm not sure exactly how much that 800,000ish is, but that is the amount that was invested a few years ago. It has since gone down in value to around 750,000 but has recently picked back up to around 780,000.

Initially mum was hesitant to pull money from that investment, because at the moment its lost money and she'd hope the longer she leaves it the more chance it will rise higher again. Investing is a long term game and a few years isn't enough after all.

But I pointed out that, yes taking 400,000 out now might indeed ""realise"" or ""crystallise"" some of that loss (I think those are the right words?), but if it really has fallen only 800-&gt;780, then that locked in loss is only a bit over 10,000 (ie half the loss for taking out half the investment).

And if she chalks that loss down as a cost of the project then 10,000 is less than 67,200 so it makes more sense to pull her own investment funds over taking the loan. Is that right? Are we thinking about this correctly? It only makes sense to take the loan if half the investment has lost over 67,200, in other words the whole investment has lost over 134,400?

The one mitigator we thought of was opportunity cost. If over the next two years the investment seriously rebounds and makes back all its loses plus 134,400 (double 67,200), then it wouldn't have been be the best choice, but that's some serious 'what if' that can't be predicted. The investment could equally lose more value.

So is that the right way to think about it? Crystallising a loss makes sense if its less than the cost of taking on debt?"|0.44|0.0|0.0|0.0
t3_1bhm9dm|1710752707.0|investing|when should you open a trade and when you shouldnt ?|"**investing** is about opening long term trades for months even years 

When you invest, you are essentially buying a piece of a company or an asset with the expectation that it will appreciate in value over time. This can include stocks, bonds, real estate, or even commodities. You are looking for opportunities that offer a good return on your investment and have a reasonable level of risk.

**Speculation**, on the other hand, involves taking on much greater risk in the hopes of making a big profit. This can include things like day trading, investing in initial public offerings (IPOs), or buying highly leveraged financial products. While there is certainly the potential for a large return, there is also a significant risk of losing your investment.

&amp;#x200B;

so my question is what are the strategies needed to invest should technical analysis be used or it shouldnt  how to put a risk assessment in long term trades.

t3_1bhkvai|1710746348.0|investing|The reasons why the Federal Reserve will inevitably cut interest rates by over 75 basis points after June|"1. The U.S. economic data can no longer mask the downturn. All rebound indicators are seasonal, and small and medium-sized enterprises, community banks, and tech companies are facing liquidity crises. Six months is the limit.  
2. The global de-dollarization process is accelerating, and the dollar system is facing collapse, especially if Japan raises interest rates. The dollar will face dual pressure from the yen and euro. Dollar issues extend beyond just economic problems.  
3. There are ceasefire signals in the Russia-Ukraine war, and anti-war sentiments in Europe and America, along with the U.S. elections, directly pressure the necessity of rate hikes. Rate hikes cannot generate asset value, and anti-war sentiments will usher in the next economic cycle.  
4. The U.S. elections are the most important issue for the U.S., and the economy is the most important political agenda. The Biden administration will not allow any economic problems to arise. Rate cuts to stimulate economic prosperity are inevitable.  
5. Judging from recent statements by Federal Reserve officials, rate cuts will be cautious, not frequent, but will also adopt a strategy of substantial rate cuts. A 75-100 basis point cut may be completed in two cuts, with a high probability of starting no later than September, likely as early as August."|0.15|0.0|0.0|0.0

Wrapping my head around all of this. 32 years old and finally have some money to invest in my future. Current plan is:

\-Open a Roth and max it out for 2023 / 2024

\-Open a SEP and at least put like $10k or so in for 2023 and 2024 (working with accountant now to see how much I can put in there.)

\-Basically put the rest of my liquid $ into VTI and live off my income (maybe put like 10% of my current liquid aside for emergency fund)

Lastly, is there anything I may be missing outside of the things I mentioned above? I have heard some people talking about Annuities which I don't know much about.

t3_1bhjab7|1710739789.0|investing|Does anyone have any experience in investing in Japanese Wagyu Cattle?|"I'm looking at expanding my investment portfolio into a few more unique prospects. One of those being Japanese Wagyu Cattle.

I've done some research on this, there's a business called Wagyu Farms of Japan where they state that for around an investment of US$10,000 you can purchase Wagyu newly-born or young calves. A Certificate of Ownership showing your Wagyu details is issued to you as a financial instrument. Affiliated farms of Wagyu Farms of Japan then grow the cattle to around 450-500 kilos where they will then slaughter it. It seems you have to pay montly fees which cover food, vitamins, medicines, vet visits, life and health insuraces, and other things. But, claim after 22 months, the cattle will be slaughtered, Wagyu Farms of Japan then buy it back from you at market rate, and the sale proceeds will then be wired to your bank account.

Apparently ROI can be as high as 60% before tax. Obviously this is just one example of a company that helps manage this in Japan for you.

So the question is, has anyone tried this, has it worked out at all, do you think a 60% ROI over 22 months is worth it for a US$10,000 investment? Really any other ideas or opinions are welcomed.

Whether it’s been wildly successful or just steadily beneficial, your insights could shed light on the diversity of investment strategies and help others think outside the conventional wisdom box."|0.92|586.0|0.0|586.0

Stock has been on a fall for past years, very undervalued right now, 2024 will be a top year given Olympics are in France, yesterday there was record volume in this stock

It has been crashing, but on this Exceptionally High Volume day in Friday, the stock price only fell 4%  even though it was record Volume as you can see on Tradinview


Does this mean there are more Buyers ?

 Signaling a Bottom of the stock ?

You can take a look at the volume on Trading view Air France KLM, it had fallen 15% 2 Weeks ago and the volume was not as high as 2 days ago, but 2 days ago it only fell 4%~

Just wondering :  


if suddenly a high volume appears in a Falling Stock, but the stock price falls less than normal, is this a bottoming signal of the stock ?

Because there are more buyers to eat up the Sellers ?

These car makers in the long term maintain or grow their earnings, yet you could have bought them many years ago at a p/e ratio of 5, and with dividends reinvested would have gotten like 10% per year, not 20%+ as the p/e ratio would suggest.

After all a company with constant earnings at a constant p/e ratio of 5 should get you 20%. My economist dad says there’s no way that’s possible, but we can see it’s true that many companies as mentioned above break this eule routinely in a major way. Some mention the heavy need for capital, but that should be long term redlected in earnings, as the investments are written off. (According to my father). 

Is it explained by them spending money badly?
That doesnt make sense as they could just pay dividends.

Can any smart people explain how these companies can maintain low p/e ratios in the long term?

I would like to purchase rental property there and I'm reviewing some stats.

* Population is up 26.8% from 2000  

* Median income is $58,202, and is up 54% from the year 2000, as per city-data  

* Median house or condo value is $219,200, and is up 121% from year 2000, as per city-data (or about 5% appreciation per year average)  

* Overall crime is down 79% compared to 2012, as per city-data  

* Vacancy rate is 4.72%, as per dept of numbers  

* Unemployment is 3.2%, as per dept of numbers (state average is 3.7%)

I plugged numbers into this deal analysis calculator (its free) that indicates the ideal purchase price for rental property based upon the income of the location (low-to-high end).

* It says the best purchase price range (all-in) is between $80k and $134k using the 4.7% vacancy rate (as shown above), 40% operating expenses and a target cap rate of 10%.
   * I didn't include a credit for any deferred maintenance or front-end CapEx expenses.
      * I'll do that case-by-case.
* It also says the ""Low"" to ""High"" rent rates (based on the median income as a ""Mid"") are $1,200/month to $2,000/month (based upon the property/location).
   * This seems a little high but I guess if I used a zip code versus the entire city, it would be more accurate (if it is in-fact inaccurate).
* I then input my APR, term, DP and CC and it tells me my cash flow would be between $240/month and $403/month, of course based upon rent-to-price ratio and my expenses.

When I input this criteria into Zillow it gives me 45 results. Which is great because I don't need to sift through endless listings that won't make sense from the jump. But, I did filter the prices up to $160k just in case there were some extended days on market and they'd consider a lower offer.

My questions are:

* How reliable do you think these data points are today? ...City data only goes up to 2021
* Are these rent rates on par as well as the vacancy rate? ...within the city limits that is...
* Are you cash flowing in this range if you have rentals there? (What are PM's charging if 7% isn't a good base...)

t3_1bfs7zd|1710546496.0|investing|Bubbles. Why Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are terrible investments.|"From a long term holistic investing point of view, the more and more I listen to Finance news and follow FinX, I hear the terms ""asset bubble"" more and more today. AI bubble. Bitcoin bubble. Stock market bubble. Commodities bubble. Bubble, bubble, bubble! It's tiring hearing of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I understand the short term implications, say 12-18 month bubble retractions, such as pretty much is the normal recession length (2022?) - but when it comes to investing in the stock market (not trading) - does it matter if there are bubbles at all?

&amp;#x200B;

The only few ""bubbles"" that I think ever mattered were the Roaring '20s and the 1929 crash, which caused the great depression - and the post-WW2 bubble that in some ways, you could argue that ""inflation fixed the problem"" - some ways it was the Federal Reserve's response, other ways it was just the market convincing retail to buy CDs and Bonds during the 1980s with high yields.

&amp;#x200B;

But in terms of the grand scheme - 20+ year time frames, investing in America seems to be immune to being a bubble. They do happen, but they are just - noise when they pop that you have to ignore. From a long term standpoint, holistic stock market bubbles don't matter because even Grandpa's Dow Jones index has always gone up over the long range.

&amp;#x200B;

Other assets such as Gold, Oil, Bitcoin, Silver, whatever the fad is - they do exhibit more bubble burst behavior and for example Gold's 1979 $2,735 peak - which really is a joke because today that means gold would have to break $11,352 for a fool who bought gold at that peak - and looking at the chart Gold has set 2 lower highs now during this post-COVID bull run... Bitcoin just broke it's ATH but it's not looking like it has much more gas from here. Silver much the same set a high of $142 in 1979 which would be $596 today - and it's barely trading at fucking $25. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah commodities such as Gold and Silver even though Peter Schiff and #silversqueeze or whatever says they are great, and I've heard there's a rumor that if Trump wins everyone pumping gold is going to give up as it's basically a hedge against Bidenomics... they do not store value AT ALL.

&amp;#x200B;

Even foreign stocks are like this. Look at Japan and China and Europe. The Japan stock market index just set new highs after 40 years from their 1991 peak... Like if you can invest in stocks even from a diversification standpoint, investing in foreign / global funds is a complete waste of money and opportunity cost.

&amp;#x200B;

So bubbles do exist if you take a defensive ""I'm going to try to prepare for the apocalypse, stock market gonna crash, inflation bad"" point of view... but seriously.

  
The Dow Jones index and S&amp;P 500 has always gone up and have outperformed Silver and Gold just ... insanely. While Bitcoin may be new and the hot thing, I can easily see it peaking like Gold did if it hasn't already done so, and then just never coming back again when adjusted for inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

So all this bubble talk about the tech, AI, whatever --- sure, it can kill your portfolio if you try to beat the market by investing in fads like Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver, but if you're in the stock market, you do good if America does good, so as a whole you are part of the cog that turns the wheel and it's never going to be a bubble as long as the cogs keep on turning."|0.28|0.0|0.0|0.0

This applies to taxable accounts,  so not Roth IRAs for example.

Suppose you’re pretty good at picking companies that are undervalued and will outperform the market by a modest margin of 10% year after year.

Wouldn’t you, with some regularity, need to rebalance your portfolio, which means selling your (future) losers? At that point, in general would you not lose 20% of your gains or more to capital gains taxes, meaning you have to outperform the market just to break even? Of course you’re not selling everything to rebalance, but over the course of an investing career, it’s very unlikely that you’ll hold only any particular position in an individual stock without selling.

On the other hand, if you were invested in a low-fee ETF, you don’t take on the tax burden of rebalancing year after year. 


Example with 10% market returns, 12% for individual stock

Index year 1 : $100 ; Stock A year 1: $100

Index year 2 : $110 ; A $112. Sell and pay 20% - $109.6, buy B

Index year 3: $121; Stock B $122.7

I’m also thinking that when my son starts kindergarten his monthly allocation would increase (due to daycare savings) while my daughter would continue to get her same amount.

Any insights how much substitution Chinese chipmakers can actually realistically achieve? (I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to but perhaps things have changed).

**China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens**

- *Directive could hurt Nvidia, NXP and other EV chip suppliers*
- *Order is a response to US efforts to curb Chinese chip tech*

The Chinese government has quietly asked electric-vehicle makers from BYD Co. to Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to sharply increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, part of a campaign to reduce reliance on Western imports and boost China’s domestic semiconductor industry.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology asked carmakers this year to expand their buying of homegrown components to accelerate the adoption of Chinese chips, according to people familiar with the matter. The country’s tech overseer previously set an informal target for automakers to source a fifth their chips locally by 2025, but has grown dissatisfied with the pace of progress, the people said.

The ministry is now directly instructing firms to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. That means overseas chip firms effectively have to manufacture their silicon through a local foundry such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. or Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., one of the people said. During a recent tender conducted by a major domestic brand, one foreign bidder failed to secure a contract despite offering a price they estimated was 30% lower than the eventual winner, another person said.

The developments reflect Beijing’s stepped-up efforts to galvanize its own tech sector, a response to US attempts to curtail Chinese chip development via sanctions and restrictions on the sale of advanced technology. The Chinese directive on cars casts uncertainty over the business of companies from Nvidia Corp. and NXP Semiconductor NV to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., which compete with local firms to supply the world’s largest EV market.

Shares in European chipmakers that supply Chinese EV firms fell in early European trading. Infineon Technologies AG slid as much as 4.8%, while STMicroelectronics NV slid 2.2%.

Many local brands buy a hodge-podge of other components from power management chips to microcontrollers and display ICs. Some carmakers from leader BYD to upstarts like Nio Inc. rely on Nvidia processors for instance to coordinate functions in their hyper-connected cars.

The MIIT didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. BYD, Nio and Geely representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Beijing is increasingly intent on supporting a domestic chip industry it knows is lagging well behind foreign rivals, but critical to supporting the economy and maintaining a geopolitical advantage. The directive is in line with pledges this year to mobilize all means at its disposal to wrest technological supremacy from the US and other nations.

The central government may also be bracing for curbs in the auto sector specifically.

Washington is probing potential data and cyber-security risks posed by internet-connected cars from China, including EVs. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has expressed concern that data collected by the cars could wind up in Beijing’s hands, and is overseeing an investigation that could result in restrictions on the sale of those cars in the US — measures that would go beyond a potential increase in tariffs.

A mandate in favor of Chinese chips also raises the prospect of further retaliation as Washington ramps up its containment campaign.

At the Two Sessions meeting of lawmakers this month, Beijing hammered home a longstanding goal to break an American stranglehold on key spheres. Under Xi Jinping’s watch, China has expanded state control of strategically critical areas from semiconductor manufacturing to quantum computing.

Against that backdrop, Beijing has endorsed the efforts of local champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. through subsidies and targeted policies. It’s now establishing a $27 billion-plus fund to drive chip investments and hiking spending on nationwide research to more than $51 billion.

China’s biggest auto chip and software providers include Huawei, Loongson Technology Corp., GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc. and Wingtech Technology Co. Many, like Novosense Microelectronics Co. and StarPower Semiconductor Ltd., have built significant capacity in so-called mature or lower-end nodes. The MIIT’s policy may soak up some of that capacity — at the expense of their foreign rivals.

The US and its European allies, meanwhile, have grown alarmed by China’s rush into older-generation chips. The Biden administration is mulling tariffs on those components in addition to other trade tools, but has said it is not considering restricting them using export controls.

While US rules introduced in 2022 slowed China’s development of advanced chipmaking capabilities, they left largely untouched the country’s ability to use techniques older than 14-nanometers. That has led Chinese firms to construct new plants faster than anywhere else in the world. They are forecast to build 26 fabs through 2026 that use 200-millimeter and 300-mm wafers, according to data from the trade group SEMI as of 2023. That compares with 16 fabs for the Americas.

What I am having difficult to understand is that they are not mentioned as estimates or forecasts but rather like results. It is like 2024 x improved by y% compared to previous year or quarter. Also, AI has become big at least since the beginning of 2023 (chatGPT). How Nvidia wasn't able to beat their 2022 financials in 2023? Is it because they have got the orders in 2023 but will be paid in 2024? If these values are estimates, are there any risks that they will be way off, considering how big the growth estimates look?

  
I have no positions in Nvidia for favor or against it.

I have a low 7-digit sum in equity that I want to invest into the S&amp;P 500 and into the Nasdaq.

They agreed to my plan with the addition that they recommended me to put 5-10% of my equity into the Euro-Buxl Future.

I am not familiar with bonds, but it was explained to me that this is a future of a German government bond. Since the interest rates of capital is sinking in Germany, the price of gov. bonds will increase and therefore the Buxl is a good investment. It was also recommended to me to use some leverage as German bonds are low in volatility. It was forecasted that the price of the Buxl will reach it's previous ATH of 176 in a matter of time and might reach 200-230 in value.

One part of my selection process is based on taking a look at the dividend yield and payout, looking for companies with a high yield but relatively low payout ratio. The assumption I am making is basically that it is a good sign if a company gives out a high yield but has a low payout ratio (compared to competitors), because it implies that even though dividends are high, the company still uses a good chunk of profits in order to grow. (Please let me know if you think this assumption is flawed). 

While researching I came across a few companies, e.g. Kinder Morgan (MO) or Energy Transfer (ET) that have payout ratios well above 100%. 

So my main question would be: why would a company pay out more dividends than actually making in terms of Earnings. To me that doesn’t seem logical or sustainable at all.

Would love to here y’all perspective on some plausible reasons behind that

For simplicity, let’s assume it constituted 100% of my portfolio. I expected that it could drop more than 10% due to the similar performance of other companies in the industry, but I was not certain. Instead of just selling it, I decided to try hedging for the first time.

So, I sold 5% of the shares at $28 and used the proceeds to buy put options with a strike price of $16, expiring in 3 months. Now, $S has dropped 15% and is currently priced at $24. Selling to close at the put ask price will cost an additional 1.5% of my portfolio (instead of getting 5% back, I will only get 3.5% back). The bid price is now 0%, and the volume is also 0, so selling at the bid price is problematic.

With my hedge, I’m down 16.5% instead of 15%. How could I have done better?

P.S. I appreciate all the responses. For those interested, here’s a brief summary:  
  
\- To hedge against a potential decline after an Earnings Report (ER), it’s advantageous to select a strike price close to the current price with a short expiration.

My (M25) situation is the following, slightly complex, but, nevertheless, would really appreciate some advice.  
Employed and living at at home (Belgium) with a net monthly salary of c. EUR 3400. Barely have any expenses so I would be able to invest/take a loan with EUR 2500 quite easily. I inherited an apartment which i recently sold for EUR 270.000 and have another EUR 35.000 in savings.  
I have been pondering a lot about buying an apartment in my mother's home country (Romania), in Bucharest, more specifically. This is especially interesting, as when we won't be using the apartment I can rent it out (short-term rental) with an expected return of about 12-15% p.a.  
Here is the thing, I could either just buy an apartment with cash, which I am not very keen on doing or I could buy stocks/ETFs and use this as a collateral to purchase the apartment and repay the loan using (my salary/dividends/savings). I am, however, unsure this is a good idea given potential (heavy) market corrections that might occur and decrease the value of the stocks, despite the fact that, by default, there nature is to increase in value in the long-term.  
Is this a reasonable approach? and could I take a loan using stocks/ETFs as collateral from, let's say, DEGIRO, or Interactive brokers or should it be with an established bank.

I am 2 years into a 10-1 ARM at 2.63%.  I am planning on saving and investing enough money over the next 8+ years to payoff my mortgage if/when the rate jumps too high.  To do that, my original thought was to invest money in an after-tax brokerage account.  After reading the article, I wonder if there is a better way.

My situation:
-401k through previous employer (paying off loan this year then moving to a traditional IRA, about $120,000)
-401k through current employer (hope to max out this year)
-401k through wife's employer (hope to max out next year)
-MFJ
-Retire in 20-25 years
-One of us will be age 59.5 in 16 years
-About $150,000 left on mortgage
-22% tax bracket (don't expect this to change for awhile)
-HSA maxed out each year 
-DINKs

The article says a Roth Conversion Ladder is the best way, but 401k with penalty is not that far behind.  If the money I am putting into the 401k was already earmarked for paying off the house or for other expenses that come with retiring early, am I wrong to think that leaving it in the 401k might be better?

So I can liquidate it without locking in a loss after transferring everything into an IRA without a second's delay...

There's only one ""Stable Income"" option. It's some kind of cryptic insurance product that generates a piddly ""guaranteed"" &lt;2%.

Figuring ""guaranteed"" was good enough, I had moved my money into it, but then later I dug into the details and saw that it was recently created, and the investment weights were page after page of hot garbage. Commercial real estate. Mortgage-backed securities. High-yield corporate debt. Some other sketchy acronyms I don't understand. Some treasuries, but very little. It basically looks like a garbage dump for derivatives nobody in their right mind would want given the current commercial real estate environment and the seemingly permanent inverted bond yield curve.

Given the low age of the fund and hearing about experiences with these things years ago were people lost all their money to ""fly by night"" funds, I immediately took out the money and put it back into the S&amp;P 500 index fund. At least I know I'll eventually get my money back if the market crashes.

I looked at the other options, but similarly they were all too heavy into commercial real estate and other sketchy things for my comfort. Seems like the fat cats are keen on unloading their garbage into my investment portfolio.

It appears to be reaching far beyond the tech sector also. This is purely anecdotal, but on a daily basis I search layoffs, sorted by the past 24 hours, and see multiple large announcements every single day. Seeing as these are public announcements via WARN notices, I'm sure there is also an acceleration of layoffs in small business that isn't as visible.

Just a partial list from the past 24 hours:

Dollar Tree/Family Dollar (1000 store closures)

IBM

Grossmont Union High School

Jacobz Technology (240)

Black and Decker (200)

Rooster Teeth Productions (100+)

Stash (80)

Niche (7% of staff)

John Deere (150)

Hamburg Central School District

Highmark Insurance (108)

Sunrise Coal (118)

Johnson and Johnson (55)

Blue Diamond Growers (38)

Prima Wawona (5000)

UL Solutions

These are all layoffs that have been announced in the past 24 hours. Not yet in the data. Day after day I see announcements like this with increasing frequency. With the recent slight uptick in unemployment to 3.9%, it will be important to see if this trend continues. The Sahm rule (0.27% currently) increased toward its threshold 0.5% but is still below its October high of 0.33%. The recent downtrend in the number was broken by the February jobs report. Of course, several more months of data will be important to determine if it will begin to trend up.

Just curious to hear everyone's thoughts on the job market and if they have seen an increase in layoffs in their area. Companies appear to have gotten comfortable with layoffs and are being rewarded with higher share prices for doing so. Layoffs tend to accelerate at a rapid pace once they take hold.

He had two tax-deferred employer retirement plans with Principal:  his own and one he inherited when my mother passed in late 2021.  I'm helping him rollover both balances to a Rollover IRA at Fidelity where the fees will be much lower and the investment options better.  Those rollover requests have been processed by Principal and we are waiting for the checks to reach Fidelity and be deposited into his rIRA.  

However, Principal just sent him a check that they're saying is an RMD that they are required by law to disburse.  I'm not aware of any circumstance under which a custodian should automatically disburse funds from an account without the consent of the client.  In fact, my father isn't required to take a RMD until April 1, 2025.  Besides that, he plans to make a QCD later this year which would fully satisfy his RMD.  Not to mention the fact that Principal couldn't possibly know if he has other RMD-eligible accounts from which he may have taken his total RMD already (or planned to).  

Even more bizarre, they only issued an amount equal to the RMD for his original account, not including the inherited account which was my mother's (DOB:  June 1956).  Yet when he called them, they claim that this RMD is required due to this being an inherited account.  It's completely nonsensical.

He wants them to reverse the disbursement and rollover that amount along with the rest of his funds so that he can then satisfy his RMD tax-free later this year via a QCD.  We also need Principal to cancel/amend the 1099-R sent to the IRS so that it doesn't cause problems when he files his taxes and possibly trigger an audit.

He plans to call again and keep pushing until they agree.  But I was wondering if anyone has ever dealt with something like this, has any advice, or can point out anything I may be missing?  Thanks."|0.44|0.0|0.0|0.0

I had sold short some covered options contracts in 2023 and held them into 2024.  
  
That makes them section 1256 contracts?  
  
And that means they mark to market the contracts and I report the gain / loss in 2023, even though the position is still open?  
  
And then in 2024 when I close the position I report that contract AGAIN and the net gain / loss that happened in 2024?!  
  
Conceivably, you could have a big gain in 2023 and then big loss in 2024. Or vice versa. 

AND the gain / loss is partly considered short and partly considered long term!? In both years?!  
  
Wow! Seems complicated??  
  
Realistically, would you know what conventional wisdom is? Does it make sense / are there tax implications if you close the position on 12/31 &amp; reopen the position on 1/2? 

Closing an ETF option contract on 12/31 - is that within the window for showing on your 1099B?

And yeah, the market could move 1 way or the other when you are out of the market. And there's transaction costs, 

For the tax debate, lets assume you can close12/31 at the price the contract will be marked to market.  And then open the position on 1/2 at that same price.

The tax due would be the same?  you just don't need to fill out the section 1256 form?

My company match (in 2023) ended up being about 15% of what I put in.
The rule is we put in 6% and they match a certain % of that based on how the year went. It is usually somewhere between 1-3%. 
This year I put in 6% each month, and at the end it seemed they matched roughly 15%(of the 6%).
So let's say I put in $5,000, they put in $750. (This was pretty close to the actual numbers)

Most companies match 1:1 right? Up to a certain percentage.

I am thinking I'd be better off just putting all of that into a Roth. Or should I keep doing the 6%. I know we want to max out the 401k for the match, but when the match % is SO LOW is it even worth it? I can't do all of the calculations so I'm hoping someone has had an experience like this.

It's also lacking a lot of technical jargon when it comes to Bitcoin Mining and investing since not all my friends are not super versed in crypto and investing.  
Company : Terawulf  
NASDAQ stock Ticker : **WULF**  
Based out of Maryland, USA  
**SYNOPSIS**  
The WULF stock price of $2 is very very undervalued.  
This belief is heavily based on the fact that after expenses the company is currently pulling in $500,000 a day (including weekends), yet its market cap or total value of the company is only about 500 million.  
Imagine buying a penthouse for $5 million dollars and then being able to rent it out at a fair market price for $1.8 million dollars a year. It would seem as if the penthouse was sold for way under value.  
Below is an in depth explanation on why Terawulf is way under value.  
**WHAT DOES TERAWULF DO?**  
Terawulf has built two facilities in New York and Pennsylvania that are basically two huge state of the art computers. They’ve built these computer facilities to create an enormous amount of computing power. They then use this computing power to make money.  
For Example: AI or artifice intelligence requires a lot of computing power. Terawulf is currently working with Talen and Amazon where they might sell their computing power to Amazon to power Amazon’s AI. Basically Amazon rents Terawulf’s facilities computing power, instead of building their own.  
This potential Amazon deal is however a speculative future endeavor and not why I am writing this today. It just helped me explain what Terawulf has built without using the scary B word... Bitcoin.  
However, that’s exactly what Terawulf is doing with their computing power.  
They are “mining Bitcoin” or using their computing power, to help run the Bitcoin network. Similar to how Google could hire Terawulf’s computing power, to help run their email system GMAIL.  
Terawulf, gets paid in Bitcoin daily, and immediately sells it for a hefty profit. The Terawulf CEO has invested millions of his own money into Terawulf and stated that the company is not in the business of speculating on the price of Bitcoin. They simply “Mine” Bitcoin everyday for a profit in American Dollars, not Bitcoin.  
**TERAWULF’S BACKSTORY**  
TERAWULF was formed in 2021, and their plan was to lock in long term cheap North American power (5-20 year plans). Not just any power, but Zero Carbon energy. Not only is it better for the environment, but in a world where regulations are moving in that direction, it’s better to be ready for it.  
Once they locked in inexpensive green power, they bought land and started construction on buildings. Right now they have buildings in New York and Pennsylvania. Two states that have had discussions and laws even passed against companies mining bitcoin... but mining bitcoin with “bad” energy. Since Terawulf’s goal is 100% carbon free energy, they don’t have to worry.  
Terawulf spent all of 2021 - 2022 getting their facilities ready. They started turning on the computers in 2023, but are still building and turning on new machines for 2024, and anticipate this continuing into 2025.  
This all leads into why I believe they are so undervalued.  
**STOCK PRICE**  
Terawulf began this venture in 2021, during the last cryptocurrency bull run. Speculation was crazy in 2021 around anything crypto and Bitcoin related. Along with many other assets and mining companies, WULF’s price rocketed to a high of $44 per share in Nov 2021.  
However soon after Bitcoin’s price went down and so did Terawulfs. WULF shares dropped as low as $0.53 in March 2023.  
Rightfully so, I mean Terawulf up until that point had just taking on hundreds of millions in debt to build their facilities. According to their earnings reports this company just lost money month after month, year after year. They were an idea in 2021.  
Most people don’t know what Bitcoin Mining is, so they see Terawulf, they see it’s a bitcoin mining company and don’t really know what the hell that means.  
They’re investors not computer tech folks. So they look at what they do know, the earnings reports and well, the earnings reports are terrible. They don’t know why or care, however we now know it’s because Terawulf is still in the building stages.  
It’s as if Ferrari spent over two years building a race car. But every month people asked how fast the race car was, and Ferrari said it went 0 mph. So everyone continued to write off this race car as a failure, without knowing that it was going to take 3 years to build.  
They shouldn’t judge how fast it goes until it’s built, just like the market shouldn’t have judged Terawulf on how profitable it was before it was built.  
I think the stock market thinks Terawulf is a fully built race car that goes 0mph, when in reality it is a half built race car that when fully built, will be the fastest car in the race.  
Earnings reports are a major factor in how investors judge a company. Most articles and reports online are based off Terawulf’s released earnings reports. Those earnings reports don’t go past sept 2023, and those reports are very bad.  
Currently, when you research Terawulf online, you’re likely to find a writeup that an algorithm wrote based off earnings reports before Oct 2023. The reports are filled with BAD numbers, and don’t explain that Terawulf was simply building their race car.  
Now normally everyone has to wait until the company releases its earnings report to know how everything going. Not with Terawulf though.  
Terawulf is not your average company, they are very transparent and have been releasing their numbers on their social media and their website. They are proud of what they accomplished and believe in a company that doesn’t hide behind walls, but instead informs investors of exactly what is going on.  
They don’t pay for fancy marketing, they just make a damn good product and wait for word to catch on.  
However, NOBODY is reading Terawulf’s reports... their twitter posts get maybe 100 likes, and a few spam comments.  
So unless you’re one of the few like me listening, you are judging their company on the terrible earnings reports from 2021 thru September 2023.  
However they just started turning on their machines in 2023, and have been expanding at a rapid rate throughout 2024.  
On Fidelity and Charles Schwab if you click on reports for Terawulf and look at earnings... MISSED in big red letters pops up.  
For investors it’s basically saying LOSER LOSER LOSER, over and over and over.  
However, on March 28th 2024 the official earnings report comes out for Oct-Dec 2023.  
Now if you’re following Terawulf on social media and understand Bitcoin Mining you’d know that Q4 was a bit of a winner this time. You’d also know that Q1 of 2024 is an even bigger winner. However, the vast majority of people simply wait for the official earnings reports.  
Basically we are ahead of curve by 6 months.  
I don’t know when exactly Wall Street is going to catch up on this, but right now WULF seems like a diamond in the rough. The confusion around what exactly is Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, mixed with the delayed earnings reports has falsely labeled Terawulf a loser.  
I anticipate that between now and summer of 2024 the market will catch on.  
We discussed the price of the stock versus the earnings of the company. This is called a P/E ratio for short. Terawulf’s P/E ratio right now is about 4/1 since the entire value of the company is four times more than their gross earnings for the year.  
In comparison to the software industry average of 56/1 which is what fidelity chose to compare it to Terawulf to.  
A 56/1 P/E for Terawulf would value the stock $28 a share instead of $2 a share.  
MARA Marathon Digital is a mining company that has a current P/E of 23/1. WULF at $11 a share would be a 23/1 P/E.  
Now there are many other factors to consider and I think $10 a share is closer to a fair value.  
I also think the stock could go to $100 a share considering how crazy the market can get, especially around something with the word Bitcoin in it.  
However I am not an expert with how to value a company like this, should it be 3 billion or 10 billion, I’m not sure. What the stock market values is a best guess.  
There’s so many things to consider, and nothing is guaranteed in this world. A comet could hit the Terawulf facility and blow it up tomorrow and drive the price to a few pennies.  
I’m not a finial advisor, I have no idea your finances nor can I guarantee my beliefs or that I am missing something. I’m simply stating what I find interesting about this company and sharing that info and my beliefs.  
Anyway, thanks for reading. Below is some more info to consider.  
**DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE**  
SHORTS  
Another reason why the price is so low, are the shorts have been opening up on this stock since 2022. This is just speculation, but I believe these shorts are coming from knowledgeable traders, who understood they would be out of profit for two years, or lenders who have hedged their investment.  
For anyone who doesn’t understand Shorts, it’s basically a way to make money if the stock price goes down, and coincidently, investing in a short position on a stock helps drive the price down.  
The shorts are slowly beginning to close and I have a feeling those shorts will close up completely by June 2024. Shorts closing brings stock price up.  
TRENDING BUZZ WORDS CREATING HYPE  
To add fuel to the fire, Terawulf prides itself in using green clean energy that’s carbon free, a very popular narrative. One thing I’ve learned in trading is that the best “story” often wins out. They also announced in Dec 2023 that they’re working with amazon and A.I. to capitalize the use of their mining machines. Two great buzz words for investors, “A.I.” &amp; “Carbon Free Energy.” This mixed with the hype around Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies makes me think Terawulf’s stock price could go from highly undervalued to high over valued.  
STOCK DILUTION  
One negative I noticed was how Terawulf has been diluting their stock. Kind of how when the FED prints more dollars and as a result the price of groceries goes up. It’s normal for a company to be issuing stock to pay bills and incentivize employees. 40% of the company is owned by insiders, which means the people working for the company seem to believe in its success. They don’t seem to plan on heavy stock dilution for 2024 from what I’ve heard them say, and while it’s something to consider, I don’t see it as a major red flag.  
WULF HISTORY  
Terawulf was started in 2021, they bought IKONICS CORPORATION in 2021. So if you look at the history of the stock ticker symbol WULF, you will notice it goes back to 1993.  
However, this price data doesn’t imply to the current company Terawulf, since as planned Terawulf sold Ikonics in 2022.  
This WULF stock history adds to the confusion and messes with any algorithms taking in numbers from the old company and projecting it onto the new company.  
Another reason why this company is flying under the radar... for now.  
DEBT  
Terawulf took on Debt, they have been paying off their debt enormously the last few months. So while the old earnings reports have their debt listed over 100 million, it’s more like 50 million and dropping.  
BITCOIN PRICE  
Bitcoins price does effect WULF’s profit, but they have set themselves up to be profitable well into the foreseeable future, including after the April 2024 Bitcoin Halving. Explaining the Bitcoin halving would be a lot right now, but it’s basically an event happening in April 2024 that effects the profits of Bitcoin miners. There’s a lot of miners that aren’t in a good position to capitalize on this event. Terawulf is in my opinion set up to be one of the most profitable mining companies after the halving. Once again this is a very complex thing to understand, but I’ve seen articles scaring Bitcoin Mining investors about the halving, and rightfully so. Just because Terawulf is set up for success doesn’t mean the Bitcoin Mining Market as a whole might not panic and temporarily drive down mining company prices. Another thing of many I’ve considered and any investor should too.  
THANK YOU  
Once agin, I could be missing something here, Terawulf could be lying like Enron for all we know, I do not know everything nor can I predict the future.  
So if you do your own research please let me know if you find something I missed, I’ll be very grateful.

I'm currently researching investment opportunities in the semiconductor industry, particularly focusing on companies that could potentially compete with Nvidia. While Nvidia is undoubtedly a giant in the field, I believe that smaller to medium-sized competitors might offer interesting prospects for growth and innovation.  
  
Could you please recommend some small to medium-cap companies listed on the stock exchange that are involved in the semiconductor space and could pose as competitors to Nvidia? Whether they specialize in graphic processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, or any related technology, I'm interested in learning more about them.

That's besides the point, well, today I put a strategy in play and bought 220 shares of ZCMD and set a stop loss above the past resistance level. The problem was when I went to sell the shares because it did what I wanted it to do, which was it went up and kept going up, but I could not sell the shares. I eventually realized it was the stop loss that was preventing me from selling, so when I canceld the stop loss, I was able to sell the shares. I don't get why I have to cancel the stop loss, I mean these things can move pretty quick and even though I actually got even more lucky this time since it kept going during the time of me canceling the stop loss. However, next time, it can definitely go down and I would rather not go through that. What am I doing wrong here. Thanks.

I stumbled across GE (which I honestly thought only made washing machines and generators) and it has turned into a bit of a rabbit hole. I might get some of these points a bit wrong, but I'm going to try and explain what I know and my confusion.

It appears that in 2017ish, GE's CEO made the call that it simply did too much. It sold off a number of parts, and eventually settled on 3 companies it would break into: one for healthcare, one for aerospace, and one for electronics. 

Since October of last year, GE's stock has shot up. Part of this is probably due to an NYT's article detailing that AI would use as much power as some nations, and the pouring in of money to energy etfs. 

The healthcare part of the company now exists as it's own publicly traded ticker. GE's electronics section is going to be spun off in early April as GEV, in a ""if you own 4 GE stocks, you get 1 GEV"" situation. 

What confuses me immensely however is why GE isn't going down. It's breaking up into smaller bits, which in my head, would mean it would be less able to profit in the future, not more. What am I missing? "|0.75|8.0|0.0|8.0

He had me open an Indexed Universal Life (IUL) policy as a means for paying for more short term goals while the money in the account can still grow, as well as having some tax-free retirement income. I'm leaning towards surrendering that as well. I have already paid the fees for that this year (\~1600 for \~16000 put in. I put in lump sums with the plan to break even on it and get growth sooner rather than later), but now after doing some research I'm not sure I want to be purchasing this product with high fees (even though I'd most likely make it back) at this age, and I'm reading that life insurance shouldn't be an investment vehicle.

Should I look to surrender the policy if I incur no more expenses? Or should I just let it sit there, get some value with the interest I'll earn next year, then reconsider if I want to surrender it or not. Honestly, could be willing to take the L on it and move on. Not sure what’s best.

Idk, part of me would just feel more comfortable having all my money under more of my control. If the IUL was the right route, wouldn't everyone be doing it?

t3_1bb24ea|1710046892.0|investing|YUM vs. QSR: A Fast Food Empire Showdown 🍔🍗|"Recently, after indulging in a Popeyes chicken sandwich, I felt compelled to dive into the financial and strategic landscapes of two fast-food titans: **YUM Brands** and **Restaurant Brands International (QSR)**. Here's a breakdown of what I found, spiced up with my own dining experiences.

## YUM Brands Overview

YUM operates well-known chains like **KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell,** and **The Habit Burger Grill**, boasting a market cap of **$39 billion**. Here's how their revenues stack up:

- **KFC:** $2,830M
- **Taco Bell:** $2,641M
- **Pizza Hut:** $1,019M
- **The Habit Burger Grill (THBG):** $586M

Despite KFC leading in revenue, its offerings, especially the chicken tenders and lack of a competitive chicken sandwich, left me skeptical about its growth prospects, especially compared to Popeyes. Taco Bell shows potential to become YUM's revenue leader, whereas The Habit Burger Grill's impact remains to be seen. YUM's PE ratio of 24 suggests investor optimism, but I question the sustainability of their growth across all brands.

Adding some metrics to deepen the analysis (Thanks to notabignaleabignale):

| Metric                 | KFC Division | Taco Bell Division | Pizza Hut Division | Worldwide |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| % Change System Sales, ex FX | +12%         | +9%               | +5%               | +10%      |
| Same-Store Sales       | +7%          | +5%               | +2%               | +6%       |
| Units                  | +8%          | +4%               | +4%               | +6%       |
| GAAP Operating Profit  | +9%          | +11%              | +1%               | +6%       |
| Core Operating Profit  | +12%         | +11%              | +3%               | +12%      |
| System Restaurant count | 29,900      | 8,564             | 19,866            | |

## Restaurant Brands International (QSR)

QSR is the force behind **Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes,** and **Firehouse Subs**, with a market cap of **$36 billion**. Revenue distribution is as follows:

- **Tim Hortons:** $3,972M
- **Burger King:** $1,297M
- **Popeyes:** $692M
- **Firehouse Subs:** $187M
- **International:** $874M (Brand split unclear)

Tim Hortons, mainly in Canada, hints at untapped potential in the US market. Burger King, while not my favorite, shows promise through innovation. Popeyes stands out with exceptional chicken and a sandwich that outshines its rivals, suggesting significant growth potential. Firehouse Subs, though newer to QSR, could become a key player.

## Conclusions and Predictions

**QSR** appears to be a stronger investment than **YUM**, driven by potential for expansion and innovation. I foresee QSR continuing to thrive, particularly through Popeyes and Tim Hortons expanding into the US, while YUM may face challenges in sustaining its current success levels."|0.77|9.0|0.0|9.0

I have some ethical qualms about buying put options, yet I do not wish to dollar cost averaging into a crashing stock.  
Since buying put options are a zero sum game, there is a losing party on the other side of the trade. Now, if the losing party is a big corporation, that doesn't matter.  
But if it's a retail investor on the other end of the trade, I would be ""taking"" their money due to the options contract. It is essentially ""betting"".

EDIT:

What I mean is this, let's say Carvana is on a 1 year decline from $324 to $4 valuation, before readily increasing back to $50.

Timing the dip is hard. So while the stock is continually dropping, I want to make profits in the meantime. Easiest way is buying puts on Carvana.

However, on the other side of the trade, there is a put seller, aka a ""short position"". If the stock goes down and I take a profit, the put seller will lose/""pay"" for my profit "|0.1|0.0|0.0|0.0

I just retired and am in my 60s, and I want to get out of the low performing 401K funds/options. My company provided some match of my 401K contributions with stock (ESPP), and that went into the 401K. I have kept those stocks purchased, for a long time, and the stock price has increased significantly.

I've researched NUA (net unrealized appreciation), and want to take advantage of that, but I am unsure of how to do it right, e.g. how do I indicate which stock purchases to cash out\*\*.

* I understand I have to do it within 12 months of a withdrawal (e.g. rollover to an IRA)
* I think I read that the NUA has to happen from the 401K; I cannot roll it over to the IRA and then do the cash out.
* I understand the income tax is on the cost basis and capital gains tax on the appreciation.
* I understand I need to be careful figuring the marginal tax bracket. I likely will jump a bracket with this, but don't want to jump up to 32% (I've accumulated a lot of stock, that has appreciated a lot)

\*\* Question: ESPP holding period, specifying ""old"" stock to sell, cost basis

* But I also read that stock in an ESPP has to be held for at least 12 months in order to claim capital gains vs. income on the appreciation, so.....
   * Do I have that **12 month** **holding period** right, even if the purchases were for the 401K?
   * How do I indicate to **use the stock that is over 12 months ""old""** vs. the stock that I received within the last year (I retired only a few months ago, so some of that ESPP is still in that 12 month period). Is there **a form I use to indicate 'older' stock**? Do I need to indicate specific dated purchases? I assume I will be able to generate a 401K report on the dates of the company match/stock purchases.
   * The company gives me a single **cost basis** for it all. Can I use that even for the older stock purchases, i.e. greater than 1 year old, or do I have go figure the cost basis for those specific stock purchases that I am selling?"|0.71|3.0|0.0|3.0

I've been hearing about [HSBC Structured Products](https://www.us.hsbc.com/investments/products/structured-products/) in recent times, and some people I talk to are quite a fan of them. Obviously the details vary on a per-product basis, but I'm wondering whether there's some hidden downside to them? It seems like in general they always have some type of upside to them such as protecting from a certain amount of losses via buffering. Of course there are maximums for the return also, but in general it seems like most of the time the maximum would not be particularly limiting. 

Basically it seemed to me like maybe they're a good option because they limit risk, while still capturing market upsides for the stocks in question with pretty reliable returns (vs using a money market or some such). I believe there might be something where if HSBC itself goes out of business then it's bad... but I'm assuming that's not that likely to happen.

So my overall question to the experts here, is whether there's some reason they are actually worse than doing various index funds."|0.43|0.0|0.0|0.0

I'm doing some mental math in my head to see how this works but its not making too much sense right now.

A. today I put pretax 2k in HSA. I invest it in HSA, it grows then I withdraw from it like a 401k when I'm 65 which I will pay taxes when I withdraw it.

B. today I put pretax 2k in HSA. I reimburse myself for a medical expense today. I can put it in a brokerage account and invest, having to pay cap gains when I use it.

The only way i see how option A is better is if I keep all the receipts throughout my life and still use it as a HSA, but now with compounded growth and I don't pay taxes on withdrawals either. Otherwise I don't see how using HSA as 401K is superior to just reimbursing myself today? Am I missing something?

From the article,

U.S. employers added 275,000 jobs last month, a Labor Department report showed on Friday, handily beating the 200,000 that economists expected.

But the report's revisions of prior months' estimates showed smaller job gains in January and December than had earlier been thought, and other details of the report suggested a rebalancing in the labor market continues.

The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, its highest in two years, though still below levels the Fed sees as sustainable in the long-run.

And wage growth has continued to edge down, rising 4.3% in February from a year earlier, down from 4.4% in January. Fed policymakers won't see that growth as consistent yet with their 2% inflation goal, but it is moving in the right direction."|0.88|140.0|0.0|140.0

t3_1bahqds|1709990876.0|investing|Trading strategy I had in mind for a while, it probably won't work but I don't understand why|"As I've learned in a while, potentially more profitable investments are riskier, and vice versa. I figured that safe investments such as index funds can return about 7-10% annually, and stuff like bitcoin can return more, but there is more risk in that. In my opinion, once someone wants to earn more than 15% annually, it starts to either be a gamble or require too much experience.

Saying that, I am fully aware of the no free lunch theorem, and I do not believe I have found the golden trading strategy, but I have had this idea for a while now and I just cannot understand why it would not work, trying to really be self-critical here. I'll try to break down my idea into these chronological points of thinking:

1. Your annual ROI is a sum of all your deals during the year. If you invest 100 euros 4 times within a year and got a 5% profit on each deal, that is 5 euros \* 4 times = 20 euros, which is a 20% annual ROI. This does not even include compound interest btw.
2. Index funds return about 7-10% annually, but there is a lot of volatility in between. This volatility is likely to be less than average annual growth, so I suppose 1-5%?
3. I plan to buy index funds anyway, I do not care if the price goes down after I buy them, I am ok with holding them for longer as they will still go out of dips eventually. However, if I buy a share and it is in the green prematurely, can I not take advantage of that somehow? This got me thinking.
4. Why not set a ""take profit"" target at 5% above investment value? If this investment sells in faster time than 1/4 of a year, I have acquired 1/4 good deals within a year that allow me to guarantee a 20% annual ROI.
5. If we scale this down, we can take profits at 1% and do 20 such deals a year, ultimately yielding a 20% ROI faster than in a year. And the lower is the take profit %, the more likely it is to be struck by volatility. This means we can theoretically buy and profit in a down-trending market. With higher take profit % we can also try to time the market and buy at dips - bad timings are long term investments and good timings are quick profits.
6. I am aware that there are trading fees and stuff, but they can be accounted for as they do not make up SUCH a huge %, right? Let's say I get 1% pulled from me from every transaction, well I can set my take profit at 2% and it is still quite likely to be hit by volatility, even in a down-trending market. I need to hit 20 consecutive deals at 1% profit and I have gotten 20% annual ROI.
7. Never close deals that are in the red, they just become long term investments.

So yeah, can someone tell me why this will not work. I know it won't work, free money does not exist, but I just don't understand what am I missing. Thank you.

EDIT:  
One reason I can imagine is that if investments are done with one pile of money, then there will inevitably come a moment where volatility does not hit the take profit % and the whole investment becomes long-term and frozen, waiting for the market to return to that price some time in future, and the entire ROI becomes equal to that of the annual asset growth.

EDIT 2:  
After multiple comments, it seems that I am trying to exploit market volatility to capture small profits reliably, regardless of the up-trend or down-trend of a market. Currently the argument against this is that, what does one do if the volatility does not strike expected take profit price?"|0.54|4.0|0.0|4.0

I’m currently 23 years old and just graduated college. My full time job doesn’t start till October so I’m studying for the CPA exams till then and Doordashing to make money while living with my parents. My goal is to max out my Roth IRA this year with most of my contributions going to VTI. However, I also have two shares of KO (Coca-Cola) that I’ve had for a while that I like to keep because of the dividend, and would like to continue to grow my position for the dividend. 

My question is, whenever I contribute money should I allocate a percentage to KO? For example if I put $1,000 would you recommend I put 85% of it into VTI and the remaining 15% into KO? Or should I do that, but start putting the remaining percentage into a high dividend ETF like SPHD? My final option would to be just focus on putting all my contributions into VTI and then having a separate brokerage account for dividend stocks. 

If the majority of the people on the sub recommend I just make my entire position VTI and forget about dividend investing in my Roth IRA, that is also a completely valid point that I have also been considering.

t3_1ba7y7i|1709955095.0|investing|Friendly PSA- General guidance.|"Not a guru or wizard here, just a guy w some decades of sucesfully dealing w money &amp; investing. Given many questions on this forum, I’m certain it is of benefit to share some fundamentals any newbro can utilize. I know you all have adhd, but try to read this. This is the whole kit-and-caboodle life pak 3.0. If you must, skip down to the dashed line.I'd first like to impress upon everyone that pure investing/trading is not a business, unless you are *selling* your investing 'skills', such as they are. One earns money with or in a *business*, not investing/trading. Fund managers become wealthy by taking a percentage of their vast AUM. social media gurus are shilling a trading platform, method, book, or connection to a higher power. Even the best of the best would take a lifetime to become very wealthy simply investing their own money. Yes there are special cases, but statistically speaking, most people do not have the luck or ability.

In this vein, I must also pre-warn about getting into day or even swing trading, especially w options, especially in 2024, even if you think you know what you are doing. As a beginner, you are a fish flake in a goldfish bowl in an aquarium in an ocean on a globe filled with great white sharks and straight-up kraken. Ask yourself why there are about a trillion places everywhere baiting people into trading… Because the monsters need to eat. It’s the same reason a Vegas hotel sells blackjack strategy cards in their own gift shop: Because the house always wins. In our case the house is the \*market makers\* and ancillary support. They ‘provide liquidity’ and set all option prices and take the spread on every sale. Leverage is not free. If you are plain buying and selling, see last two sentences of above paragraph. MM's influence prices of just about everytihng through all sorts of means.

We can see personal investing is primarily for preservation of wealth, to not be eroded by inflation and at least keep pace with ‘the market’. There are many types of securities-- from stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, crypto, collectables, plus forex, and you name it. They all have a place and time. It's easy, just 'buy low sell high' lol. (couldnt resist).

\---------------------

So, given all that, here are the basics. You'll not need much more to get a solid start.

**\*Universal\***

\-**Enjoy life, but try to be frugal** and not live beyond your means. Balance. Start now

\-**Max your IRA/401k contributions if able**. (Roth generally better if you start it immediately, but it's not a massive difference.)

\-**Open 5 credit cards** (maybe stagger them to avoid a big hit) and use some of the credit, but not over about %30 each. (Paying on time and preferably in-full goes without saying! CC’s charge you %18 interest!!!  Amex is good for this) Points are a fun, use for travel.

\-**Buy a small ratio of physical bullion**, gold or silver, and keep it personally, for that omg shtf moment. To that end also, you can do a minor amount of prepping, though this scenario is not very likely.

\-**Security-- Legal and Physical.** Know the laws and rules of all types; know of an attorney who could help you should you need it. Make a will. Avoid marriage if possible (LOL). Million dollar baby: protect yourself at all times.

\-**Tax, conducive areas, and politics.** A penny saved is a penny earned. Starting out you wont have to worry much about this, but once you have something to lose, it becomes a big deal.-Bookmark Investopedia. Spend many hours there.

**\*Cyclical\***

The old rules are somewhat disintegrating. It used to be stocks vs bonds vs commodities... Rebalance at the shift, then back again, but today everything is haywire. You can and should do whatever works at the moment. It is early March 2024, so speaking to the current environment.

\-**Bonds. Buy short terms, roll them over (or buy a bond etf), then reevaluate when rates raise.** There is a reason many big whigs own lots of them at the moment; interest rates are high. The difference between a guaranteed return (unless the gov defaults, which almost seems plausible today; see bullion above) and a risky return is the risk premium. If I can get 5%+ on a 3 month bond, why gamble on the market for an extra 1or 2 % in a crazy time? We are in a bond yield inversion, which is when short-term yields are higher than long-term yields. This usually precedes a stock correction but that doesn’t mean crash or recession... necessarily. Im currently about %50 gov bonds.  You can go municipal also, though not sure why given not better return. I’d avoid junk rating or even BB. The fed indicated they will lower rates a bit maybe June, which is what’s driving stocks; keep you ear to the ground. You can buy 10yrs to lock in a higher rate.

\-**Stonks. Go with an index fund or blue chip w 4%+ dividend and chillax.** It’s fun picking, just know you are not a genius. Keep a small amount for play and if you really feel something, go for it… with only that money. Take a shot on pennies. The market has been on a rip, especially tech/AI. I’m a bit of a bear and a cheap skate, so I think everything is over priced. That’s not necessarily so. I too owned NVDA and sold it for a decent profit, but missed the jet boat to the moon. Not buying it now no way. Maybe things are fairly valued given trillions of stimulus, and the next AI wave…. or not. (Thinking about the singularity makes most of this moot anyway).   I’d avoid banks, as I get a cold-raspy about credit problems, NYCB already went bust, this could implicate larger banks... or not. Banks, as we know, have fallout for the whole market. There will be a correction within a year Ill bet regardless.

**-Real Estate (mostly residential). Yes.** Perhaps the best form of passive income. But the market has been bought up entirely, and sadly, likely will be that way for probobly ever. If there is a housing correction and if you are able, grab a SFH in the 'goldilocks' zone, 3br2ba, medium-good neighborhood, upper middle price. ie: a 'B' property. \*Get a good  manager\* They are worth the 9% commision. \**Do your own dilligance on the property, not what some dingbat agent tells you*\*.  The rent will pay your mortgage. Commercial I would avoid as that is a very bad market now, and takes alot more expertise always.

\-**Options, only with a small %.**  Again, fun, but the market makers will eat you eventually. If you’re at that point where you really know how it’s done, then you are not reading this anyway. Fart around with some play money, and don’t feel bad when it disappears.

\-**Crypto, ??**  I understand the tech, but… who really knows what it will do. No one. You may not believe this, but I owned 86 BTC early on, then yes, sold it for about 4x profit (pretty good at the time!) Again, no jet boat for me. It’s a gamble.

\-**Collectibles, do your homework.** These are very specific, as in down to the item. Unless you or someone you truly trust is a bona-fide expert on 1970’s Ferrari’s, Japanese Pokemon, or sheep skin Victorian douches, do a lot of research. That’s not to say throwing money at something can’t work out-- everything is on a tear now especially art-- but long run you’ll do better knowing what you have. Antiques Road Show is fun as hell.

\-**Forex, don’t.** Do you have an international business/finance masters with deep knowledge of a specific nation’s economics and events, and are heavily connected to boot? No, then you’re gambling. Soros did get lucky, but a lot more behind the curtain.

**-Commodities, ehhh, still don’t.** Similar to Forex-- you need expertise. Futures are traded on all things, but primarily on commodities. Navigating all this is well beyond mortal intermediate investors.\*\*-P2P Lending, meh.\*\*Tried it, meh. I think other securities offer more for less effort."|0.46|0.0|0.0|0.0

&gt; 
&gt; Disney shareholders are expected to vote on Disney's new board at the shareholder meeting on April 3.
&gt; 
&gt; A mysterious shareholder of The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is looking to purchase 500,000 proxy votes for $100,000 from the Magic Kingdom’s other shareholders ahead of next month’s contentious proxy fight between hedge fund billionaire Nelson Peltz and Disney CEO Bob Iger.
&gt; 
&gt; A proxy vote allows a person or a firm to vote on behalf of a company’s shareholder at a shareholder meeting. Usually, if a person wants to buy 500,000 proxy votes, it would cost them around $55 million in stock. However, the Shareholder Vote Exchange (SVE), a California-based startup that provides a platform for shareholders to sell their proxy votes to the highest bidder, reduces this cost significantly. Disney shareholders are eager to sell: already, more than 23,000 proxy votes have been put up for sale on SVE’s platform.
&gt; 
&gt; Founded in 2021 by Preston Yadegar and Steven Xu, SVB facilitated the sale of 400,000 proxy votes in 2023 and “is on track to do much more this year,” Xu told Observer. Yadegar founded SVE a year after his graduation from Boston University and serves as the CEO. Andrew Shapiro, the founder and managing member of Lawndale Capital Management, serves as one of the advisors.
&gt; 
&gt; Since January 2023, Peltz, the founder of Trian Partners, has engaged in a proxy fight to gain board seats at Disney. He has received backing from Ike Perlmutter, the former chairman of Marvel Entertainment who sold his company to Disney and remained there until being fired in March 2023. Perlmutter has helped increase Peltz’s Disney stake to 33 million shares, worth around $3 billion.
&gt; 
&gt; Iger and the Disney board have encouraged shareholders to vote against Peltz’s bid to join the board and picked up backing from activist hedge fund ValueAct. The shareholder vote to confirm Disney’s new board will take place on April 3 during the company’s 2024 shareholder meeting. As attention builds on ahead of the meeting, Xu said Disney now “easily accounts for a third or even a half of all proxy votes up for sale” on the platform.
&gt; 
&gt; Xu did not reveal who the anonymous buyer is, but he confirmed it is a current Disney shareholder rather than an outside player.
&gt; 
&gt; While 500,000 proxy votes is a fraction of the total 1.8 billion Disney shares outstanding, it can be enough to sway a proxy war. In 2017, Peltz lost a proxy fight with Procter &amp; Gamble by exactly that many votes, roughly 0.02 percent of the total P&amp;G shares outstanding at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; SVE is the first of its kind to create an open platform for trading proxy votes, but the practice is not new. In 2002, Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, used “vote buying” to get shareholders to approve the company’s merger with Compaq. In a 2005 Harvard Business Review article recounting the events, authors Luh Luh Lan and Loizos Leracleous wrote that vote buying “may be illegal in politics, but in the corporate arena, it is a legitimate, if controversial, strategic tool.”
&gt; 
&gt; A Delaware judge ruling on Fiorina’s vote-buying found that the practice did not violate the state’s laws: shareholders have a right to sell their votes, and companies do not have a right to interfere.

I’ve never bought a call option and want to understand everything before I start. I know I can exercise the call option early but that would require me to buy all 100 shares at the strike price.

To be clear, my concern extends to banks who are heavily exposed to CRE.

My question: if you buy into a bond fund with a coupon of 4.someodd% with a longish duration 5+ years. As interest rates fall, the value of the fund will rise. Bond cost moves inversely to interest rate yeild. Makes sense, older bonds with higher interest rates would pay more then newer bonds paying less. Old good, new bad, I get it. Okay so, then to what are the bond funds interest rates pegged? I mean, it's a fund so you can move in and out as you like. If interest rates fall and the value of the fund increases are you then getting paid interest on the increased face value of the fund, or are you getting interest paid based on the initial amount invested? i.e.

100.00 per share 
4.7% coupon 8.5yr duration 

Interest rates fall 1%: it's my understanding that a bonds cost will increase by a multiple of it's duration(though I could be entirely mistaken)

Hypothetical new fund value 108.5 per share

Do you get paid interest based on the new value of 108.50 as someone buying into the fund at that cost would? Or are you paid based on your initial 100.00 investment?

Update: 

I re-read the terms and reviewed the transactions and there is no match, discount, or look back. The purchases are made monthly on the same day of the month every month, so there is no benefit to using them over an individual brokerage.

I’ve kept $25 a week going into it since I think the company is moving in a good direction, but have moved my additional investing funds into a separate brokerage account with automatic VOO purchases instead.

I wanted to get some advice regarding when it's appropriate to take profit and when it's best to let it continue working.

I have a situation where I invested into a specific stock (NVIDA) that has taken off beyond anything I ever expected.  I started with about 100k as my initial investment, and have since taken profit to cover this cost basis.  Cost basis has been re-injected into my index / growth fund, leaving a lot of profit still working in the particular stock.  

I have several other investments, including small real estate and savings / index funds / etc ... and all of them are well funded and healthy.  After taking my cost basis back, I still have quite a lot still on the table in the stock, but it's not a life-changing amount that could fund the rest of my life or anything like that (at least not yet).  

At what level would this stock be worth cashing in or taking more profit, and what would I do with the proceeds ?  I could take it off and add a significant amount to my funds, and collect the 8% + that it would yield, but it's doing much better than this 8% where it is, which is why I'm conflicted.  

There are no large capital expenditures that I want to make, I own my home outright, and I didn't have a plan on any additional real estate (but I have thought about that), and the family and kids are set for now.  

At what point is it not worth the risk of leaving this sum working in the stock, considering that I've already gotten back my cost basis?"|0.68|14.0|0.0|14.0

To me they look like a quasi mutual fund in that I can own shares of a company that owns a basket of real estate, much like FXAIX is run by a company, Fidelity, that allows me to own a basket of stocks.

So it seems like there are two risks. One the real estate market goes down. Well the stock market can also go down over the short term. But both stocks and real estate have trended upward for long enough I am convinced they will continue to do so over my lifetime. The other is that the REIT could be cooking the books like Enron did. Well it's conceivable that Fidelity could do the same. So it looks to me like the risk profiles for a well managed REIT and a mutual fund are similar.

Some of the REITs I have looked at were the belle of the ball prior to 2008, yet have traded basically sideways ever since. But they produce, and have produced, for a long time dividend returns well over 6%-8%.

So my question is, what am I missing? Why isn't everybody in these?

t3_1b7lupo|1709685651.0|investing|Industrialised world demographics and its effects on future growth.|"I have been researching lately about the potential problems that the worsening state of the industrialised world's demographics (falling fertility rates, aging population...) may impose on investing and asset classes values, and how to prepare for it.

For example, people have been researching this already for decades and the 1980-90 Bull run seems to have been influenced greatly by the baby boomers which drove the economy up.

-here's a link to a research about this, very in-depth and worth reading-

https://www.ft.com/content/11dcfe2e-3314-11e2-aa83-00144feabdc0

Real Estate - logically seems to be the one that will take the largest hit, right? Since theres less people, and probably more housing build (pesky greedy investors can't stop building new ones) it kind of seems that supply and demand will kick in and do its thing, which, to me, seems to be already happening in japan, which also has one of the worst demographics.

Stock Markets - Also would probably take a large hit since if there's less people there would be less money being made and less products sold - or maybe inflation increases drastically and people just become richer from there being more wealth/person since theres less people now (kind of like after the black plague in Europe in the middle ages) and people just spend more so the profits of companies dont change? Not really sure about this one, would lovw to hear comments.

Gold - To me seems like the safest one but the most boring to invest in (low roi). Gold has always been seen as the ultimate value by humans ( its colour, rarity, doesn't chemically chamge, malleable into jewerly, electronics...) and i highly doubt it will ever  become obsolete

Commodities - Similar to gold i suppose, humans will always need corn, oil, steel... Probably less of it though as the population decreases.

Businesses/Equity/Acqusition - I would suppose kind of similar to stocks

Bonds - Not exactly sure how would the macro-demographics affect this one, altough seems a bit safer than stocks imo (lower roi altough).

It seems difficult to find something worthwile investing in that's going to somewhat endure the future thats ahead of us. I dont want to FUD but i am afraid of what comes in the next 50 years especially because of things such as worsening demographics and also AI ( tech jobs).


Please feel free to share your thoughts and opinions, i would love to hear them.

But Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, made an open wager to anyone who would accept it. He would choose a passive index fund and run it against any hedge fund and he was certain the passive index would come out ahead over 10 years.

This was a golden opportunity for any hedge fund manager. If you could beat Warren Buffett, at the time the third richest person on earth, investors would flock to your hedge fund, and you would be far richer than you were now.

But only one person took him up on the wager. And at first they pulled ahead, but ultimately they lost. They actually conceded before the end, knowing it was a foregone conclusion.

Buffet chose vanguard admiral shares s&amp;p 500, a fund anyone here can invest in—with minimum deposits.

While the outcome was a bit surprising, and the fact everyone was scared to go on the line against a **passive fund**, one thing that always irked me a little was Buffett himself is the premier active investor. 

So it’s a little weird to suggest: do what I say, not what I do. And I understand it. he has teams of people to help him, vastly more time to devote to investing, and vastly vastly more money in order to squeeze out the most returns and get deals we couldn’t possibly get ourselves.

t3_1b7a8mo|1709657907.0|investing|Why is gold at an all-time high, while gold miners' stocks are at the bottom?|"The answer is simple - costs are rising faster than revenue. Let's look at Barrick Gold Corp.:

2016: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) – 674, Realized Price ($/oz) – 1248. 2023: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) – 1335 (approx. x2), Realized Price ($/oz) – 1948 (approx. x1.5).

As a result, gold prices increase, but miners' EPS doesn't see the same rise.

However, in the next year or two, the rise in gold prices could accelerate. It's already happening, even though rates have yet to be cut.

We might see a repeat of the 2020-21 story - gold reaching new levels with a sharp increase in free cash flow and EPS for miners.

Bought:
$3k worth of BTC (plus an additional 700 I already had)
$3k in VOO
$1k in QQQ

I have about $2000 in cash in my brokerage that I’m looking to distribute between individual stocks.

I was looking at regional banks, as the entire sector is down.

The main three that caught my eye as possible buys are the following:

FITB $35.70
•3.95% Div yield 
•EPS is ~$7.2 less than industry average ($3.22 vs $12.46)
 •Forward PE 10.16 
•-2.93% 52W High

KEY $14.79
•5.62% Div Yield
•EPS is ~$11.4 less than industry average ($0.88 vs $12.46)
•8.87 Forward PE
•-20.31% 52W High

CFG $32.30
•5.26% Div Yield 
• EPS is ~$7.1 less than industry average ($3.13 vs $12.46)
•7.95 Forward PE
•-22.31% 52W High

I personally am leaning towards FITB as I think they have the most room to grow, but regional banks aren’t big growers so I was unsure if I should target a higher dividend yield.

If the community likes another bank I’m open to it! These were just the three that I found that seemed interesting."|0.61|4.0|0.0|4.0

 Is contributing only in a brokerage account going to impact future profits that much because of the taxes? Should I just find something to make $7000 this year so I can hit the max contribution?

t3_1b74a1d|1709642518.0|investing|Compound Interest &amp; Retirement Math|"I'm trying to combine these two financial ""rules/math"" and want to see if this is a reasonable expectation.

1. At 7% annual gains, your balance will double every ten years.
2. If you withdraw 4% a year, your balance will stay stable, as long as you earn 4%+ in annual gains.

Therefore, if someone has $300,000 saved and plans to retire in 20 years, is it safe to assume that in the first 10 years, the balance will double to $600,000 and in the last ten years it will double again to $1,200,000? And by withdrawing 4%, that provides an annual income of $50,000?

The key factor being that there are no new contributions being added, only the $300,000 original balance is the principle. 

Of course there are market down times, inflation, taxes, diversification needs, etc that would need to be added as a buffer, but I'm just gut checking that a $50,000 annual income can be derived from a $300,000 principle 20 years prior."|0.67|7.0|0.0|7.0

TLDR: I have a prototype of the Android application, which is navigation app, but also has feature to buy virtual areas with ability to resell them, and this could be used as investment.

  
As mentioned above, this is an application, which uses Augmented reality technology to navigate in the area, and registered users can buy virtual areas for a reason to exceptionally use them or to resell them later. 

  
The backstory of this application was simply just attempt to develop 'something', for fun, and I have chosen AR as a technology which I see could be perspective. After couple of years I started to think on how this application can make money. I have refused ideas to add ads or to make this app paid, so I was thinking about the other way.

  
My question would be: as the community interested in investments, would you be interested in new type of assets? I use word 'asset', because I cannot find any other word to describe this.

How come I'm able to buy a 100$ bond on my brokerage (Public) that matures in 14$ at 5-6% interest, but then other bonds will be 6 - 12 months at same price and around 6-7% interest. I know some of them will payout semi-annually / quarterly percentages but is that the only advantage to buy into 'long-term' bonds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just for a little further information, most bonds on Public trade at the same price of around $80-$100 with most top 7 companies, there are $50 bonds for higher risk companies that pay +10% interest, but I understand the risk in that, just trying to figure out why I would not just buy 100$ bond and make $4.50-$6 every 2 weeks.
